We ask you to consider all the victims of state-sponsored, Saudi-financed terrorism, their families and their survivors in the UK and all over the world.\"\r\n\r\nLast year, a long-classified section comprising 28 pages that detailed potential Saudi government ties to the attack but which had not been verified, were finally made public.\r\n\r\nEarlier this spring, a lawsuit was filed in New York on behalf of the families of 850 individuals who were killed and 1,500 who were injured.\r\n\r\nThe suit, which was filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York and will be heard US District Judge George Daniels, seeks unspecified monetary damages and says Saudi supported Al-Qaeda in four critical ways - supporting government-linked charities that ran training camps, directly funding Osama Bin Laden's terror group, supporting the hijackers by providing them with passports and, finally, and providing on-the-ground support to the hijackers in the 18 months leading up to the attacks.\r\n\r\n\"9/11 could not have happened without Saudi Arabia's support for al-Qaeda,\" said lead lawyer Jim Kreindler.\r\n\r\nMany believe Britain and the US share a long history of promoting and using extremists when it has benefited their strategic, economic or military goals. Mark Curtis, the historian and author of Secret Affairs: Britain's Collusion with Radical Islam, wrote recently that Saudi Arabia's role in promoting Wahhabism had been known for decades.\r\n\r\n\"The British elite is perfectly aware of the insidious role that Saudi Arabia plays in fomenting terrorism,\" he said. \"In October 2014, General Jonathan Shaw, a former Assistant Chief of the Defense Staff, told the Telegraph that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were primarily responsible for the rise of the extremist Islam that inspires Isis [Daesh] terrorists.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time that a British government has sought to protect strategic ties with Saudi Arabia by covering up embarrassing or damaging information.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Tony Blair halted a major criminal investigation into alleged corruption by the arms company BAE Systems and payments to Saudi officials involved in the Al-Yamamah arms deal, after it was decided continuing the probe would endanger Britain's security - the same excuse cited by Rudd.\r\n\r\n"},

Mohammed bin Salman said that he '\"wants out\" of the two-year war he started in Yemen and that he was not against US rapprochement with Iran to end the conflict.\r\n\r\nAdam Baron, a Yemen analyst, said that a Saudi pull out is not going to be \"complete\" since the kingdom's security is largely reliant on Yemen's security.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the Saudis would like out of the war-but only on their own terms,\" Baron said.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"What's broadly necessary would be a deal that ensures Saudi interests are preserved in Yemen,\" Baron told Al-Jazeera.\r\n\r\nThe conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and has injured more than 40,000 to date.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, an air strike on a hotel near the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, martyred at least 35 people, a local medic said.\r\n\r\nYemen has long been the Arab region's poorest country, and previously relied on US aid and assistance from its neighbors to stay afloat. Inflation was worsening and unemployment rates soared prior to the 2011 uprising.\r\n\r\nMoney from the country's dwindling oil reserves has been wasted or stolen.\r\n\r\nThe war has left various areas in dire need of humanitarian assistance and has enabled al-Qaeda to grow amid a security vacuum.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Yemen, home to more than 27 million people, is on the verge of famine and in the middle of an \"unprecedented\" cholera outbreak. Referring to the Saudi-led war in Yemen, the UN has warned that the country is heading towards \"total collapse.\"\r\n\r\nCurrently, more than seven million people are on the verge of starvation due to border blockades and impoverishment from years of war, while about 80 percent of the population are reliant on some form of humanitarian aid. According to the UN, the world's largest humanitarian crisis is in Yemen.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia's involvement has contributed to the country's humanitarian crisis, damaging Mohammed bin Salman's image both internationally and regionally, says Luciano Zaccara, Gulf politics researcher at Qatar University.\r\n\r\n\"The increasing criticism worldwide against the coalition attacks - considered the main reason behind the cholera epidemic that is killing thousands of civilians, the obscure situation of detainees, and the blockade of Sanaa airport and Hudaida port that is preventing humanitarian supply to arrive to the blocked areas..., are making this war very unpopular,\" Zaccara told Al-Jazeera.\r\n\r\n"},

Police suspect that Milchan may have benefited from the fact that the majority stake went to Blavatnik's RGE rather than a rival bidder.\r\n\r\nNetanyahu has already been questioned as a suspect in Case 1000. But if police find evidence that Netanyahu worked to promote Milchan's interests in the communications market, this would strengthen the case against him. So far, the only thing Netanyahu is known to have done for Milchan is to help him renew his visa to remain in the United States.\r\n\r\nEvidence that Netanyahu tried to mediate the sale of Yedioth to Blavatnik would be less significant for Case 2000, senior police officers said, because the case is primarily concerned with the negotiations between Netanyahu and Mozes over the prime minister's support for a bill that would hurt \u2018Israel' Hayom.\r\n\r\n"},

In the Name of Allah, The Most Compassionate, The Most Merciful. Peace be upon the Seal of prophets, our Master and Prophet, Abi Al Qassem Mohammad, and upon his chaste and pure Household, and upon his chosen companions, and upon all messengers and prophets.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings.\r\n\r\nIn my last speech, I promised to talk after the battle - which was ongoing with the Nusra Front - comes to an end. As we are through with this stage, and have begun a new stage, it became obligatory that I give this speech to clarify some ideas, illustrate the path, and specify some points, and highlight responsibilities.\r\n\r\nFirst, I would like to congratulate the captives who have returned to freedom and to their homeland. I also congratulate and offer condolences to the families of all martyrs - all the families of martyrs - for their dear ones who passed away and reached what no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever felt. Blessed and pleased may they be. I also would like to salute the wounded fighters and the mujahedeen. I ask Allah Almighty to bestow patience on them to bear the pain of their wounds, and we pray for a quick recovery for them. I congratulate everyone in Lebanon and in the region on this victory - the accomplishment of the full victory - in this battle which is over. In particular, I congratulate the mujahedeen who made this victory with their hands, arms, and sacrifices. In parallel, I thank all the Lebanese people who received our freed captives yesterday in Baalbek - Hermel, along the Beqaa, the South, and in the various villages and towns. Special thanks to our people in al-Qaa who from the very early morning embraced, welcomed, offered helped, and were true partners in this achievement. \r\n\r\nBesides moving into the topics of my speech, it is my duty to reassure the rest of the noble families, as we still have bodies of martyrs in the hands of the various armed forces. Indeed, with the Nusra Front there are no more captives - perhaps there is a captive or two. There is a missing brother, we do not know if he was martyred or if he is a captive with Daesh held in the Syrian Desert. In the Desert battle, we have a group of missing brethren regarding whom we do not know so far for sure whether they are martyrs or are still alive. As I know that these hours and these moments are very difficult, especially for the rest of the noble families, I want to assert to you that the specialized sides in Hezbollah are following up this file with utmost precision, loyalty, and honesty. I am personally following up on the file which is an object of care. Let no one of you be hesitant. You must all be sure that we are working day and night on this issue, because this is our religious, moral, and jihadi commitment towards you and towards these patient, noble, and struggling families.\r\nSo we are before a mission which was achieved. There is another mission which was achieved. Thus we are before new missions, new conditions, and new responsibilities. I want to tackle two topics and end up with an issue - an extremely important issue indeed. \r\n\r\nAs per the first topic, I want to tackle briefly what was achieved and the remaining details and following up (certain issues). Moreover, we have to perform our moral duty towards what was achieved. That's because our religion is that of religious fairness. In fact, the divine religion is fairness, and whoever does not thank his fellow beings does not thank the Creator, and with thanks blessings last. So on the one hand, for moral reasons, I want to tackle briefly - not all that took place - but only the important things that took place. On another hand, I will tackle that and accordingly, take the appropriate decision on how to tackle the next stage and to benefit from this experience in the remaining and upcoming files. \r\n\r\nWell, as per the first topic, in my last speech, I told you that night that the military battle reached this point: we are now working on two lines, the field and negotiations. Hours after the speech, complications were resolved. Negotiations advanced, and we were able to reach a final agreement, and this final agreement was implemented. Thus you are acquainted with its details and course of events, and I do not want to take your time with the details of this issue. \r\n\r\nHere allow me from the very beginning to laud the remarkable efforts and strenuous and critical work that were exerted by Major General Abbas Ibrahim. Many thanks and full appreciation and prayers from all of us to him. May Allah grant him more and more success. May Allah open up (resolve) through his hands all the next and upcoming files and issues. \r\n\r\nWell, under this topic, I want to tackle several points:\r\n\r\nThe first point has to do with the Syrian side.\r\n\r\nThe second point has to do with the Lebanese side. Then I will move forward.\r\nFirst, as per the Syrian side, as I said, to be fair and to benefit for the next battle and files, we must not overlook this issue; we must rather talk about it with transparency and clarity. \r\n\r\nFirst, from the very beginning, this battle was backed by the Syrian leadership which offered it all possible facilitations. Now there is the field, and there are the negotiations. When we went to battlefield, the Syrian Army was fighting in the Flitah Outskirts, and we were fighting shoulder to shoulder next to them, and they offered martyrs. The media has not been that fair towards the Syrian Army and its sacrifices on this front because the media was focusing more on the Lebanese Front. Thus we must appreciate the Syrian Army and its sacrifices, martyrs, and the wounded in this battle. However, what is important to draw benefit from for the next battle is to say the following outcome: what helped in putting a decisive end to the battle within a very brief period of time is fighting on two fronts: the Syrian Front in the Flitah Outskirts and the Lebanese Front in the Arsal Outskirts. Consequently, the Nusra Front was fighting on all fronts, which broke up the power of the antagonist enemy and, consequently, swiftly put a decisive end to the battle. \r\n\r\nSo the very important outcome which the Lebanese must know now is that one of the reasons for the swiftness in ending the battle and liberating the Arsal Outskirts is our fighting along with the Syrian Army in the Flitah Outskirts at the same time. \r\nSecond: when things reached that far in the battlefield, and the gate was opened to negotiations, the Syrian leadership gave the preliminary agreement for whatever side that wishes to join in the negotiations to participate in them. \r\n\r\nIndeed, we were contacting them directly. The Lebanese state was the side concerned in the negotiations, and our brethren in the Syrian leadership did not have any problem in that. They facilitated the initiation of the negotiations to the effect that they had no problem in that, and that they would cooperate with the Lebanese to reach the desired result. Otherwise, had the Syrian leadership from the very beginning said no, things are through in the Flitah Outskirts, the Nusra Front is now in the Lebanese outskirts and Lebanese territories, and let the Lebanese resolve their own problems by themselves, and they are not concerned with this file, things would not have moved as they did. However, on the contrary, they did not deal with this issue as such at all. From the very beginning, they acted very positively, knowing that this file means transferring the burden from the Lebanese side to the Syrian side.  You are deporting militants, regardless whether the media reported a right or wrong number for the militants. There is no problem in that. Well, let's say they were 200, 300, or 400 militants, no less and no more - I just dont want to give a precise number and be responsible of what I say. For sure their number is no more than this. However, after all, these are being extracted from among the Lebanese people and placed among the Syrians - in Idlib which is the launching pad for a battle against Aleppo or Hama. In fact, the Syrian leadership acted ethically with this Lebanese file. \r\n\r\nThird: during negotiations, they were not picky as far as formalities are concerned. They did not demand the Lebanese cabinet to convene and officially demand Syrian help in this regard. Never! They did not think of all of these details which some people in Lebanon stop at even at the expense of the blood, pain, and the sufferings of the people. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, they did not put conditions. They said what we ask for in Syria, we ask in Lebanon: transportation means, light arms,  verification means...They did not put any more conditions. They did not even put a ceiling for the number. They did not say we accept a maximum of such and such numbers of militants, displaced, and civilians. They rather let the negotiations move along. Afterwards, we reached an agreement, and they agreed on it without any complications. When we went for implementation, as you saw on TV, the delay took place here. However, when reaching the Lebanese-Syrian borders, from the Lebanese-Syrian borders to the Saan checkpoint in Hama Countryside, which is the last point for the swap operation, things went quickly and smoothly. Moreover, facilitations were offered more than in any operation in the past as you saw on TV. \r\n\r\nThis issue must be mentioned and appreciated, and the Lebanese must see and know that this is how this issue was dealt with. \r\n\r\nThus, I want to list several points that resulted from this issue. First, it is our moral obligation to thank His Excellency President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian leadership, the Syrian officials, the security sides that followed the operation, the Syrian Red Crescent, and all those who were in the field all day and night during the past two or three days to achieve this mission and restore to us our captives whom they received at the Saan checkpoint. \r\n\r\nHere I want to draw the moral from this issue as we drew the moral from the battle in the Flitah Outskirts and the Arsal Outskirts as per the battlefield. The moral I want to draw as per the negotiations is that I want to tell the Lebanese people, Lebanese public opinion, and especially the Lebanese politicians, whether they are official or non-official: let's reconsider this issue for a while. This operation included transporting hundreds of militants and thousands of families. Well, there was no United Nations or the Red Cross. There were no international sides. To the last crossing point for the Lebanese Army in Arsal to the Lebanese-Syrian borders in the Arsal Outskirts and Flitah Outskirts, the guarantee was the Lebanese General Security based on the guarantee given by Hezbollah because our military is present there. Here we are talking about the course pursued by the convoy. There are about 300 kilometers from the Syrian borders to the Saan crossing point. They crossed this distance in the darkness of the night and in daylight from the Lebanese-Syrian borders to the Saan crossing point. For about 280 kilometers or 290 kilometers, the guarantee was the Syrian state or the Syrian regime. By the way, I do not consider the word regime to be negative - it is rather a positive word. The Syrian state or the Syrian regime lived up to all their promises. No one was subject to any harm. It offered them facilitations, and as such the issue was over. \r\n\r\nThis experience comes in the framework of other experiences inside Syria including Madaya and Zabadani, and we are ready to listen to anyone who has anything else to say. The media outlets are available to confirm what we are saying. The Syrian state and the Syrian regime always observe their commitments as per transferring the convoys and the militants based on the set measures and conditions. So there is no danger. Even as per all the settlements and reconciliations, the Syrian state fulfills its promises. In many areas in which reconciliations and settlements took place, people are living in security and peace. The other day, I watched a report on television which shows that Zabadani is again a place for restaurants and parties and a peaceful life.\r\n\r\nSo let no one hide behind this issue. Let no one wait for the UN and wait for a political solution in Syria or the like. What I recommend and call for is: do not deal with such issues as a political issue or a political conflict or a financial file. Rather deal with it as a humanitarian file. Here I reiterate and say again: I call on the Lebanese government to take a responsible stance. Let it act based on the interests of the Syrian refugees and the interests of all the Lebanese people. Go and negotiate with the Syrian government, and you will see that things will move as smoothly according to the required guarantees. They are saying that they are worried, afraid, cautious, and the like.\r\n\r\nWell, now we come to the third point on the Lebanese level. In my previous speech, I talked about parties, political forces, ministers, deputies, media outlets, and media, social, cultural, artistic elites...today, allow me on the Lebanese level to talk about officials from a moral perspective too, because that has to do with the negotiations and accordingly, stances will be taken in the future. \r\n\r\nFirst, I want to talk about His Excellency the President of the Republic in a way that does not embarrass him being in the post of the president. He approved of negotiations taking place, otherwise, Major General Abbass Ibrahim could not have been able to carry out the negotiations without the approval of the President of the Republic at least. The President followed up the negotiations and offered all necessary facilitations to secure their success and assumed every responsibility for that. \r\n\r\nOn other hand, I implicitly know through evidence of his sympathy and love to the martyrs, the wounded, the fighters, and the people who offer sacrifices. What is also important on the official level is the speech he delivered on Army Day in which he considered the lastest victory for Lebanon as being the liberation of a dear area on the eastern border from the clutches of terrorist organizations, besides safeguarding security and peace in it. So a brave president of the republic came to say that this victory is a victory for Lebanon, and this victory liberated the outskirts from terrorist groups, and this victory safeguarded security and peace in that area. So they are a few sentences but taking into consideration the political complications that surround the president of the republic, the stance is very much advanced. Indeed, this is what is expected, and we offer him the highest appreciation.\r\n\r\nSecond: his Excellency the Prime Minister in fact adopted this battle from the very first day and followed its course in the field as we said. He also followed it when we started talking about negotiations and the details of the negotiations. He defended it forcefully, lauded it highly, and confronted steadfastly the sharp tongues because we had already taken our decision, and we were occupied in the battle. The Premier in fact confronted all the sharp tongues, and he dealt with the issue on a sympathetic, political, and humanitarian level, saying that those who are fighting in the Arsal Outskirts are his children, his family, and his people. This is a stance which is always highly appreciated. We were repeating the experience of July and August 2006.\r\n\r\nHere I want to be fair from the very beginning. The Premier from the very beginning approved of the negotiations and agreed that the Major General launch the negotiations. He further offered all the facilitations, and I know that there are things on which he approved that might have caused him some embarrassment, however, he agreed because he cares for the success of the negotiations. Well, someone may say that I am showing very high morals, and he may discuss intentions. Well, let them discuss with us our negotiations; however, we have nothing to do with the intentions of people. Allah knows more of their intentions. Still, when anyone does something rightful, we appreciate his stance and his responsible conduct too. We must be fair to him even if we disagree politically.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he said that Hezbollah achieved something in the outskirts. This is a step forward God willing. That's because were we to take into consideration the stance and the statements of the Future Movement and the Future bloc, we would have been in a totally different place. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the (government) heads and the state acted with responsibility as per this issue, and this led to the full accomplishment of this victory - Praise be to Allah. Now everyone has a percentage or a share in this victory which he can magnify or diminish. There is no problem in that.     \r\n\r\nThere is a third obligation under this topic, as we are talking about morals and offering thanks and appreciation, though some people would try to evade this. We in the Arsal Outskirts and Flitah outskirts, when we fight, we fight with capabilities, ammunitions, and expertise which we received primarily from the support of the Islamic Republic of Iran which never fell short in supporting us. Let the whole world know that when fighting the terrorist groups, it is the generous support of the Islamic Republic of Iran that stands behind us, supports us, and enables us to fight the terrorist Takfiri groups and gain victory over them. Indeed, the Islamic Republic plays other roles in this issue which took place, but we keep it for the coming days in order to benefit from it better later. \r\n\r\nThe fourth point: to complete what took place in the Arsal Outskirts, we still have the transfer of Saraya Ahl al-Sham from Wadi Hamid and Al Malahi and the other families who wish to leave too - the families of the Syrian refugees which are in these camps and wish to move to the Syrian interior within the framework of the Saraya Ahl al-Sham file. We are currently following it up since we wrapped up the previous issue at midnight or early morning. \r\n\r\nThe brethren started working with the concerned Syrian sides which previously gave the preliminary approval to achieve this issue as soon as possible God willing. Those (people) will be transferred to their destination, and they will reach it in security and peace with local guarantees, without the United Nations, the International Red Cross, and all the modifications which some may set. \r\n\r\nThe last point under this topic is the status quo. The area which was controlled by Nusra is liberated now. I do not want to reiterate the achievements. The results of the operation were announced by a statement issued by the Resistance operations room which tackled this issue. So I do not want to reiterate. We are now in the Arsal Outskirts. I said before and I will reiterate now that we are ready to hand over control to the Lebanese Army Command at any time they set without any reservations. We are ready from now and even from before now to hand the entire area which was liberated, all the posts, and all the points. Now I reiterate my belief and advice. We are not tired because we are heading to a new battle which I will talk about in a while. Still, I advise that this procedure take place as soon as possible for the good of the people of Arsal and the people of that area. As such, the people will feel assured. The people of Arsal may as well be able to gather their harvest such as cherry and apricot. They can manage to do that. People may return to their quarries and normal life. This issue is over for us. We have nothing in that area, and we do not want to impose our presence on anyone there, and we do not want to contact anyone there. \r\n\r\nThe residents of Arsal are our dear people, and this is their land and orchids and quarries, and they can go to their quarries. However, it is better that the army takes control of that area. Under the control and care of the army, the state would govern the area there and the movement of the people of Arsal, and this is better and preferable. \r\n\r\nHereof, I want to wrap up the first topic: we are before a mission which was successfully achieved. We are before a major victory, a military victory, and a triumph in the field that yielded important and advanced results. \r\n\r\nThe second topic pertains to Lebanon and what it is coming to and the remaining outskirts that are controlled by Daesh. I will tackle these points for the Lebanese public, which followed the first battle and wishes to follow the coming stage so that the Lebanese will be acquainted and aware of facts and figures. \r\n\r\nWell, first under the second topic, I say that Daesh controls a vast area, part of which is Syrian territory and the other Lebanese territory. Now in the media outlets, you will see the map of the area controlled by Daesh. It is a wide area, and the border is approximately in the middle. Part of the land is inside Syrian territory, and the other part is in Lebanese territory, and it comprises what remains of the Arsal Outskirts - I am not sure if this is precise or not - as well as the al-Qaa Outskirts and Ras Baalbek Outskirts.\r\n\r\nI hope no one will pick on us as per the total area controlled by Daesh. It is approximately 296 kilometers: 141 kilometers in Lebanon and 155 kilometers in Syria.\r\n\r\nThe borders are delineated. The Interior Minister said it is a disputed area. I believe the residents of Arsal disagreed with him in what he said. Should it be a disputed area later, the Syrians will argue with us over the mountains and the orchids. Anyway he corrected his mistake. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the border is clearly delineated. There is no problem whatsoever in the demarcation of the border. It is absolutely clear from both sides. The nature of the topology there is very similar to the Arsal Outskirts and Flitah Outskirts - meaning the previous battle. It has mountains and valleys. Its quarries are less but its topology is tough from both sides. That means that if the Lebanese want to liberate this area, they have to climb upwards, and if the Syrians want to liberate that area, they too have to climb upwards. The peaks and the highlands are controlled by Daesh. In saying this, I am giving you an idea about the geographical nature of the area over which the battle may be waged. \r\n\r\nI said in the previous speech that when we are through with Nusra, we will talk, because I had some information that there is a new inclination as per the area controlled by Daesh. So I did not want to speak beforehand and announce a stance at that time. However now, it is clear in the whole country that the Lebanese Army is the side which will undertake the operation of the liberation of Ras Baalbek and al-Qaa Outskirts - let's say the rest of the Lebanese Outskirts to be precautious in what we say in case the residents of Arsal have a part of land there. This has become clear and overtly announced. All its preliminary measures have started. I want to proceed under this topic based on this fact. Thus I will move forward based on what was said before. Otherwise, concerning Hezbollah, it acts in coordination with the Syrian government. Before starting the operation in the area that was controlled by Nusra (Arsal Outskirts and Flitah Outskirts), we coordinated with the Syrian leadership to fight on both fronts (Nusra and Daesh) to end the armed presence this summer. However, we divided the battle to two parts. The first stage is Nusra, and the second stage is Daesh. Now it is excellent that Lebanon officially took a decision that the Lebanese Army will undertake this mission in the Lebanese territories and on the Lebanese front. That would be a development which may be described as historic and strategic. Whatever you may call it, it is absolutely excellent.       \r\n\r\nSo, I hope no one will believe that he is taking anything which may have been ours. \r\n\r\nLet me first comment on this orientation before moving to the battlefield. In the first place, the Lebanese Army is able to perform this operation no matter what its magnitude is. Some may talk about the ammunition, the arms, the number of soldiers... But I say that with the capacities, arms, number, and the competent command, officers, and soldiers it has, the Lebanese Army is indisputably able to achieve this mission. It does not need the help of anyone. \r\n\r\nWhen we read in some communication means about American help or other aid, my view which I would like to say beforehand is that this is an insult to the Lebanese Army. If the great, competent, brave, Lebanese National Army needs American help from the Americans to liberate 141 kilometers squared, this would be a catastrophe. Well, I am sorry but we have to tackle this issue. \r\n\r\nAnyway, it is excellent that the Lebanese Army took such a decision. Here between parenthesis I would like to say something to all those who evoked this argument. In fact, I do not want to debate; I only want to make a quick comment, and I will leave tackling this issue for later on. Always the problem is not in the military institution or the security institution in Lebanon. Never! The institution is competent, and there are excellent officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is in the political institution and in the political decision. Let's analyse what the Interior Minister was saying yesterday about the operation in the Arsal Outskirts. I do not want to accuse anyone. Indeed, I know this issue.\r\n\r\nWho prevented the Lebanese Army from executing that operation? Is the Lebanese Army capable of performing that operation?\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Lebanese Army is capable of doing so. Is it able to execute the operation in Ras Baalbek and al-Qaa and unable to execute the operation in the Arsal Outskirts? Both operations are the same; perhaps the second is more difficult - or is it the first? I do not know. Military men may decide on that. However, let's say at least they are the same or almost of the same toughness. \r\n\r\nWhy is it that now it is able and in the past it was not? No! From the very beginning it is able; however, the problem is in the political decision and the political institution. The same applies to previous cases when the army was attacked in past years. It is a wonderful coincidence that the same day on which Nusra and Daesh violated all of this area and Arsal, the army, and the security forces, is the very day on which they withdrew defeated. This is one of the blessings of Allah Almighty. When the army was attacked, its vehicles and tanks were hit, and its best officers and soldiers were killed and captured, why the decision was not taken then for the army to assume its responsibilities, no matter who the Premier and the President were at that time - they are concerned in taking the political decision.\r\n\r\nThe question is: who prevented it? Did we prevent them? Did Hezbollah prevent them? Allah Almighty and the army know at that moment who supported them, opened fire on them, and provided cover for them. Some people usually do not like to talk about this.\r\n\r\nHowever, were the decision taken on that day, we were ready to support the army and this decision with our eyes and blood. It is not Hezbollah and it is not we who prevented defending the dignity of the army and the security forces and restoring the officers and the soldiers and that area. Go and inquire about who prevented that. \r\n\r\nA couple of weeks ago who said no? Who prevented? Did we Hezbollah prevent so that all this uproar took place and the decision of war and peace was evoked? Did you take the decision of war and we competed with you on it? Did you take the decision of liberating occupied territories and we competed with you on it? Did you take the decision of liberating the captives and we prevented you and competed with you? Did you take a decision to expel the terrorists who killed your soldiers, officers, and people, and we prevented you?\r\n\r\nAnyway, go and ask who wants to build a state. We have an integrated army, security forces, and institutions. We have a problem in the political decision, the political mind, the political choices, and the official political leadership. \r\n\r\nToday surely we link great expectations to the presence of personalities such as General Michel Aoun as a president, and we consider that to be a great development, and we bet on him on the decisive war on terrorism and the terrorist groups, and that he after all is able to take the state in that direction. \r\n\r\nSo the problem was here, and whoever wants to solve the problem, its solution is here. It is not the story of arms. Give that side arms, and leave the field for it. \r\n\r\nShould we have stepped aside three years ago, the flood of refugees in Arsal was telling the Nusra Front to continue their way to Beirut. This is on social communication sites. Should we have exited from the confrontation, where would the country have been? Forget about us. Go and build a state. \r\n\r\nIf we have the strongest army, the best arms, and the best security apparatuses, yet have a political leadership which is unable to take a political decision, gives consideration to foreign factors more than to internal interests, and cares for a wink from this minister and a wink from that ambassador and at times an article in the New York Times is enough to change the political track, then that won't lead to the building of a state. \r\n\r\nNow let's go back to our main point; I will continue this later. I will also postpone talking about sovereignty, the state, the outskirts, the land, the human being, security, and the people. Its time will come later. \r\n\r\nUnless new decisions arise, since this decision is taken, we are heading towards a battle. The Lebanese Army will fight on Lebanese territories. \r\n\r\nTonight I will popularly and officially announce what we will report to officials. Wherever we are present on Lebanese territories, we - Hezbollah - are at the service of the Lebanese Army and the Command of the Lebanese Army. We are ready for whatever service you need. Stop here! We will stop. Help us here! We will help you. Confront. Erect a confrontation line as the army did in Arsal. We will erect that line. Leave this area for us to act at our ease. We will leave it. Hand us the area. We will hand it. \r\n\r\nWe are with you, next to you, and under your service in whatever you want from us. We want for this battle eventually and emotionally to end in a quick decisive victory God willing, and we are praying that this victory would be achieved with the least human costs because every officer and soldier in the Lebanese Army that is martyred is our brother, son, and dear one. \r\n\r\nThis is Lebanese land, and we have no conditions whatsoever. Our hand is open to the other. \r\n\r\nAs per the Syrian front, it will also be open to Daesh. The Syrian Army and Hezbollah will be on the Syrian front. I said that the area is almost divided equally. Perhaps the confrontation on which fighting will take place on the Syrian front is a bit longer from the confrontation line on which fighting will take place on the Lebanese front. We will fight there, and we will be present there. \r\n\r\nNow let's talk morals and human values. Let no \"political philosopher\" in Lebanon say that the Syrian Army and Hezbollah must not fight on the Syrian front, and that the Syrian front must be silenced. It goes without saying that when there are two open fronts on one area, whether we like it or not, people will coordinate with each other and talk with each other. \r\n\r\nSo do not hide behind your finger. If a \"philosopher\" in Lebanon turns around and says that the Syrian front must remain silent, he would be conspiring against the Lebanese Army, the officers and soldiers in the Lebanese Army, and the people and their sons. Why is it so? That's because if that front is calm and no bullet is being shot and no attacks are being staged, that would mean that Daesh will gather all its forces to fight the Lebanese Army. All its militants and fire would be against us, and we must be cautious with Daesh as it may resort to suicide bombers, and consequently, we will put the Lebanese Army before a costly confrontation. It will gain victory after all, but the confrontation will be costly. So let's put political grudge and annoyance aside and deal morally with this battle. There are people on the other front too who are offering their children and dear ones whether they are Syrians or Lebanese. After all, getting rid of Daesh from these outskirts is a Lebanese and Syrian interest. \r\n\r\nConsequently, the front will be one front. I also want to add that the timing of the front is in the hands of the Lebanese Army in the first place, because on the other front, the Syrian Army and Hezbollah are ready. We were ready after we were through with Nusra. \r\n\r\nWhat postponed the attack is the new development in the form of the Lebanese Army assuming this responsibility over the Lebanese territories. \r\n\r\nShould the front be opened from both sides, that would fasten the victory, and it would make victory be achieved with fewer costs for everyone. Here when we talk about costs, we do not talk about money, arms, and ammunition. We are talking about human beings. We are talking about the best men in Lebanon and the best men in Syria. \r\n\r\nThis is what we are heading for. \r\n\r\nThe last point under this topic before reaching the end is an address to Daesh who are now in these mountains and these outskirts. The leadership of Daesh must know that there is a final decision, and nothing is postponed. The battle is not postponed for the next spring or summer. Perhaps few days separate us from the battle with Daesh. I do not know for sure, because the decision is in the hand of the Army in the first place. However, it must be known that the Syrians took a decisive and final decision, and consequently, Daesh can't remain in the Syrian mountains and outskirts. On the Lebanese level, Daesh will face a battle that will attain national Lebanese consensus perhaps for the first time, and this is more of a miracle. Consequently and apparently, all the Lebanese will stand behind the Lebanese Army - and this is what is taken for granted, and they will offer all the political, media, and field support if that is required to accomplish this mission. I will tell Daesh that the Lebanese and the Syrians will overcome you from all fronts and confrontation lines. In the Arsal and Flitah Outskirts, we were fighting on two fronts. No, they were rather four. Now, we will come from all fronts and confrontation lines, and you will not be able to remain steadfast in this battle.  This battle has no horizons; it is rather a losing battle for you. You are definitely losers, and should you fight, you will be either killed, or wounded, or captured. For this reason, it is better to make good calculations. \r\n\r\nNusra did not listen to what we said, and they tried. Now you can think very well. After all, the door may be open to negotiations, though conditions may be different because there is a central cause represented in the captives from the Lebanese Army soldiers and the Lebanese security forces. \r\n\r\nAnyway, this issue will be addressed in this battle whether through negotiations or through the battlefield, and we will come to know the results. You are before two choices. You have little time; a day or two or three. I am not sure what the Army leadership will decide on. Make your decision. Should you choose the field, the field is ready and its result is final for sure, and as His Excellency the President said on Army Day, Lebanon will be before a new victory too. On the Syrian front, we too will be before a new victory. The issue is now in their hands. \r\n\r\nThe last issue which I want to tackle is political investment. Well, in what does Hezbollah want to invest the battle of the Arsal Outskirts? Make some suggestions on how we may invest our victory in Arsal!!! O my brother! We are defending our land, people, and villages - Muslims and Christians. The investment is that we are doing our obligation towards Allah and our people. We offered all the sacrifices. If there is anything more, tell us about it because you are more expert in investments. If anyone among you does anything of trivial or little importance, he remains fighting for investing it politically for 100 years. We will go back to this later. \r\n\r\nNow we reached the last point which I will tackle tonight. It is an old issue but it was evoked in the cabinet and in some media outlets. It was even leaked on purpose in some media outlets because there are some sides which have the intention to cause sabotage. Consequently, I am concerned in commenting on it. It is the issue concerning Lebanon and Kuwait.  \r\n\r\nThe issue was evoked some time ago, and it is aroused in Kuwait. It is the Abdaly Cell which they called the Cell of Hezbollah. Indeed, the state calls it the Abdaly Cell but there are people in Kuwait - because of some political affiliations, especially those who came to Syria and fought and brought along money, and bought rockets and killed and slaughtered - who have an interest in creating big trouble in the country. Thus they say the Cell of Hezbollah. I want to comment on this issue because it was leaked to the media; otherwise, over the past period of time, we were trying to address the stance through certain means. \r\n\r\nFirst, I want to assert Hezbollah's great care and final assertion for the best relations between Lebanon and Kuwait, between the two states and the two peoples. We acknowledge for Kuwait its support to Lebanon and its good intention when it offered help even after the July War. The stance of Kuwait towards Lebanon was always very good and that is highly appreciated, and we are thankful. \r\n\r\nWe in Hezbollah care for the good ties between the two states and the two people, and we do not want anything to stain these ties, and we do not want any minute details that may harm this relation. We are ready to discuss any ambiguity via diplomatic channels or official channels away from any machination whether in Lebanon or in Kuwait - at the level of some political forces. We also are keen on addressing the latest developments with wisdom and calmness God willing.\r\n\r\nAs per this cause there are two parts. The first part is related to Hezbollah in Lebanon or \"we\" - the Hezbollah whom they talk about. The other part is related to the Kuwaiti brethren - some of them are arrested, and the others are not in custody. They were tried, and the sentences were issued, and they were accused. \r\n\r\nAs per the Kuwaiti brethren, they defended themselves and hired a lawyer. They used the available means to clarify the issue, and consequently, I will not interfere in this except if I was forced to talk about it in the future because I am following up the issue, and I have information to this effect. \r\n\r\nI will rather talk about the part related to Hezbollah. I want to tell the Kuwaiti officials and the Kuwaiti people based on a truth that the whole world knows: in case I want to talk about something, and we are accused, whether that was in an Arab country or in a non-Arab country, I am not afraid of saying the truth. \r\n\r\nIn the past, when one of our brethren was arrested in Egypt, several people suggested that we do not talk or adopt what took place. However, I appeared on television and adopted the incident. I said that this is one of our brethren, and we commissioned him for a mission which was against the law in Egypt. Well, we said that we will see how to address the issue. That was our intention. I would like to remind you that the brethren - one brother - was accused of a conspiracy to topple the regime. \r\n\r\nAnyway, also we declare overtly that we are in Syria. We declare overtly (regarding) whatever place we go, and we are not afraid of that. I have nothing to be afraid of - I only care for national and Arab interests. Accordingly, what is said to the effect that we sent arms to Kuwait is not correct. I do not want to use other descriptions. Let's address the issue calmly. It is not true that we sent arms to Kuwait, it is not true that we have arms in Kuwait, it is not true that we purchased arms in Kuwait and gave them to someone else, it is not true that we smuggled arms to Kuwait. Nothing of this is true at all. \r\n\r\nNow there is an arsenal, and you know the details about it. That is a Kuwaiti affair, and I do not want to approach it now. However, it is not true to say that Hezbollah purchased arms, sent arms, smuggled arms, stored arms, or has arms in Kuwait.         \r\n\r\nSecond: it is being called the Cell of Hezbollah. This is not true. Hezbollah has no cells in Kuwait, and it did not form cells in Kuwait whatsoever. It does not have cells or members in Kuwait within its organization, duties, and work.\r\n\r\nDoes Hezbollah have supporters in Kuwait? Yes, it has supporters everywhere in the world. However, it does not have members, cells, or arrangements, whether they are Lebanese or Kuwaiti. This accusation is not correct. \r\n\r\nIt is really ridiculous that they are accusing Hezbollah of instigating the Kuwaiti brethren or colluding with them to topple the regime. This is similar to the accusation against our brethren in Egypt who were similarly accused of toppling the regime in Egypt. \r\n\r\nThis is groundless. We did not instigate them, and they are not thinking in such a way too. Allow me to defend them. It never crossed the mind of any of those accused - neither the elderly, the young, the scholars, the ministers, the youth, the teenagers, the men, nor the women - to topple the regime or fight the regime, or rebel against the regime or sabotage peace in Kuwait at all, and I bear witness to that before Allah in this world and in the Hereafter. This is my information. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, get me one person who is ready to come and say he came and sat with a Hezbollah member or with me and that we instigated them against the government in Kuwait or the Prince of Kuwait or the officials in Kuwait. On the contrary, we always talk and support a political inclination which comprises participating in the parliamentary and municipal elections, partaking in the government, cooperating with the authority, observing the law, observing the order, national unity, positivity, security, civil peace...\r\n\r\nThis is the true stance. This is the stance of Hezbollah. We never wanted for Kuwait except all that is good, security, peace, and integrity, and all these accusations which were made towards Hezbollah are invalid. Allow me to tell you that these are political accusations, and go and search for those who stand behind them. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I do not want to talk about anyone other than me; if needed, I will talk later about others. \r\n\r\nI hope that God willing this issue will be addressed in Kuwait. I tell you without courtesies that we bet and appreciate the fatherhood of his highness the Prince of Kuwait and his wisdom. I am one of the people who were very much moved when I watched the conduct of His Highness the Prince and how he acted on the day Daesh bombed the Mosque of Imam al-Sadiq (peace be upon him). Thus I hope that Kuwait will God willing emerge from this crisis which is given more than its magnitude. It is used in political liquidations and manipulated for regional considerations. God willing this crisis would end up leading to that which will boost the security, integrity, coexistence, national unity, and sovereignty of Kuwait. \r\n\r\nI reiterate that the big bet is on the fatherhood and wisdom of his highness the Prince in addressing this file. In case there is any ambiguity concerning any point linked to us or to our stance, we are ready - via the means you find appropriate and via the official channels - to clarify this ambiguity and cooperate in any direction for the sake of the welfare of Kuwait and the welfare of Lebanon. May Allah bestow prosperity on you all. \r\n\r\nLet's return to our original issue. Should Daesh act logically, there is a chance. I do not know if that would work out or not. We have to talk with the brethren in Syria to see if that would be addressed or not. That will not be easy too. Anyway, the door is open. Should they choose confrontation, we will head towards a national confrontation which enjoys a national consensus in a noble battle in which we will all gain victory, God willing.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings.\r\n\r\n"},

I thank you for your huge attendance on this day on which we mark a great holiday. It is one of the days of epics and days of victories which were made by heroism and sacrifices. I welcome all scholars, ministers, deputies, and all officials, security forces, military, partisan, political, social, cultural, municipal, civil, and media representatives. I welcome you all and especially the families of the martyrs, the wounded brothers, and the freed captives who are among us today. \r\n\r\nI will start with the particular significance of the place. However, allow me first to comment briefly on the atmosphere of happiness which we witnessed a while ago. This joy is required and recommended. The martyrs offered their souls so that you and us all remain in our land, living in pride, honor, and with raised heads. Be sure that your martyrs today are happy for your happiness. What makes them happy and what rejoices their hearts is to see your smiling faces, your joyous souls, and your cheerful celebrations. \r\n\r\nI will start with the specialty of the place. I will start from here, the Khiam Plain, which witnessed one of the epics of steadfastness, courage, perseverance, and great battlefield achievements, which was in itself part of a group of battlefield achievements that formed the battle and led to its decisive outcome.\r\n\r\nThis plain is known as the Khiam Plain. Khiam is a large town high up there on the highland. It is the town of knowledge, culture, jihad, resistance, steadfastness, benevolence, and coexistence between Muslims and Christians. It summarizes all of Lebanon. After the plain, this kind town with its kind residents is known for its detention center which is known as the Khiam Detention Center. When Khiam is mentioned, the detention center comes to mind. The enemy sought via this detention center to break the will and determination, to cause souls and spirits to submit, and to crush the minds and hearts. However, it recorded via the detained men and women heroic epics of great patience, unmoved perseverance, and loyal adherence to the resistance, and refusal of occupation, humiliation, and disgrace, despite the great sufferings which these captives met in this detention center. This epic of suffering and heroism must be part of the educational curricula to be taught in schools for the generations to come. \r\n\r\nKhiam and the other frontal border towns, as well as the towns deep in the interior, fought for 33 days and remained steadfast despite thousands of aerial bombings and artillery shelling and incessant advance attempts to occupy and control them. Still they remained steadfast.\r\n\r\nThe eye of the enemy was on Khiam for its value in terms of morale and its geographic position which is decisive in the battle. Still, the resistance men in the town and the residents who remained in the town with them fought as the residents of the other towns on the barbed wire line fought, recording marvelous legends of heroic steadfastness and perseverance.\r\n\r\nMost of the town was destroyed but it was reconstructed, as here in Lebanon there is the will of resistance, steadfastness, construction, revival, and life - a life with dignity and pride. This is an expression of the adherence of this great people to their land, villages, hills, fields, and valleys, which this people will never abandon.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNow we return to the Plain. Years ago, we marked the anniversary of the July War in Wadi al-Hujeir.  No doubt Wadi al-Hujeir was a Merkava massacre. The \"Israelis\" too talk about a Merkava massacre in Wadi al-Hujeir. Khiam Plain comes as number two. It follows Wadi al-Hujeir, and it is called the \u2018Merkava conflagration'. It is enough to read the text of the commander of the battalion which entered this plain. He and the commander of the squad above him thought that Khiam is a besieged, destroyed town, and that this plain is empty and that no one in it will resist. There is no possibility for resistance in it. They thought that it would be an easy operation and victory such that it is realized and final. However, read the \"Israeli\" text. The head of the battalion says: \"Here it is difficult to find an expression better than geese under fire.\" So it is as if there is a group of geese or ducks and the hunters are opening fire on them. Imagine the scene depicted by the head of the battalion: \"The tanks were under fire. Merkava tanks and Puma vehicles were being directly hit. One of the soldiers was killed. The engineering battalion commander was directly hit. As such the force dispersed all over the valley, whereas the panic-stricken soldiers (who like mice were hiding in their vehicles) got out of the vehicles and hid inside the area\".   Indeed, several tanks were destroyed, and this is documented, and the footages are available. Several tanks were burnt, and several tanks fled. He also said that two tanks fell in water canals. I don't know which water canal. I am not there to go and search in which canal the tanks fell. He added: \"The tanks drowned, and their muzzles sunk too, which made it very difficult to rescue them\". Later on, the commander of the Northern Area talks with the commander of this battalion and tells him: \"You have to end this mockery which you staged and withdraw. Enough with the idea of controlling Khiam!\" He added: \"A few Hezbollah soldiers made a full military battalion lose their way and get perplexed using the simplest fighting concepts.\"\r\n\r\nO brothers! The story is not that of numbers and tanks. The story is about men. A few men remained in the plain despite thousands of \"Israeli\" raids and thousands of artillery strikes, and the horror of the advance of a full military battalion. Still they remained steadfast like the deep-rooted mountains. They do not get shaken or unsteady. On the other side, a battalion of the \"Israeli\" army, when it gets hit with some anti-tank missiles, flees like terrified mice in the area. This is the formula that prevailed in the July War. Here you find the resistance man who believe in Allah and his cause, rights, path, and resistance. This is the truth of these men whom we call the men of Allah. The men of Allah believe in Allah and work to achieve His content; they love Him and adore meeting Allah. On the other side, you find those who falsely claim to be the worshippers of Allah, to the exclusion of mankind. They do not wish for death, they rather love life even with humiliation, fleeing, and hiding. This is the main lesson for today. \r\n\r\nThe sample presented by the resistance in Khiam Plain, Wadi al-Hujeir, and all the other plains, hills, mountains, and valleys in the south, is the very sample (present today), with the exception that it is much more developed and advanced. It is advanced on all levels, whether regarding quality, quantity, and type. It is developed on the level of men, fighting expertise, fighting types, and the kinds of capabilities. Any \"Israeli\" land troop which may enter our land, mountains, valleys, or hills, will not be met with a sample of the Khiam Plain or Wadi al-Hujeir of 2006. That would be a hundred times more advanced. This is the truth which awaits them. The defeat, the humiliation, and the shame which were afflicted on them in that war would be tenfold in any future war. \r\n\r\nBrothers and sisters! Eleven years have passed on the war which we are marking victory in, (a war) which the \"Israelis\" call the Second Lebanon War. Still it is forcefully present in the minds of the \"Israeli\" military, political, and security leaders, \"Israeli\" public opinion, and popular \"Israeli\" disposition. This is proof that it left a deep impact on the recesses of the \"Israeli\" mind, and the \"Israelis\" deal with it as an exceptional, historic event in the history of this entity and this people who usurped Palestine and al-Quds. Thus, this anniversary has never passed without being the focus of comments, research, and scrutiny. For 11 years, this never stopped. This war was and is still the subject of their research, studies, arguments, discussions, plots, concerns, expectations, and psychological warfare. That's because for the \"Israelis\", this was a great, important, and crucial event which they are still studying. Days ago, I was following some statements. Some want to summon the Winograd Commission again because after 11 years more things were discovered which were not revealed 11 years ago. They are still studying and drawing lessons and filling up gaps. They are still exerting efforts to restore the confidence which was destroyed in the July War between the \"Israeli\" people, the \"Israeli\" Army, and the \"Israeli\" leadership. This was the most crucial repercussion of that war. They are trying to search in the minute details to find an achievement here and an achievement there even if that would be a lie - now I do not want to go into details. After 11 years, they are still acknowledging their defeat on the one hand, and the magnitude of the challenge which the resistance in Lebanon forms on the other. I want to draw your attention to this point. For the last 11 years and especially in the previous year, the \"Israelis\" have been talking about the growth of the power of Hezbollah. They talk about \"Hezbollah\" by name. They talk about the number, the troops, the vast experience, the arms, the kinds of ammunition, the missiles, the range of these missiles, the precision of these missiles...\r\n\r\nHere I am telling you on the July anniversary: with every statement and every time the \"Israelis\" talk about the growth of the power of Hezbollah, they are acknowledging their defeat in the July War 2006. Why? Because the main goal of the July War and July aggression in 2006 was to crush Hezbollah, and not (merely) weaken it. The goal was to crush Hezbollah and to defeat it once and for all. Well, for 11 years, the \"Israelis\" have been talking about the growth of the power of Hezbollah, the development of its capabilities, the number of its missiles, the precision of its missiles, and the number of its fighters. What does that mean? That means that they are acknowledging that they failed to achieve the main goal of the July War 2006, and they are facing this problem now, especially in the Herzliya Conference which took place a few months ago. The focal point is the main threat posed by Hezbollah. How are they to deal with this threat? Then comes Gaza, the resistance in Gaza, and the experience of Gaza which is the twin and comrade of the resistance in Lebanon. This is the main problem which the \"Israelis\" are suffering from and which they articulate continuously.\r\n\r\nUsually in every speech on \"Israel\", it is supposed that we say something specific. Today, I do not want to talk about the number of fighters because I tackled this point before. I do not want to talk about missiles because I talked about that before, and there are other things which I will postpone for the future. However, there is something specific I will talk about to make clear the subsequent responsibility as per Lebanon. What is the responsibility of the Lebanese people and the Lebanese politicians and everyone? When we talk about the liberation in 2000, whether by the hands of Hezbollah or the Amal Movement or the other Lebanese and Palestinian resistance front factions, the liberation of 2000 was not made via claims, slogans, calls, hopes, dreams, and expectations. It was rather the result of the serious hard work of the resistance in all domains. The same applies to the victory of 2006 which today we are marking. Were it not for the serious resistance which fights in the field and were it not also for the official political steadfastness (which I will talk about later), this victory would not be achieved. I want to tell you that following the victory of 2000 and 2006 and following all that is taking place and the events that took place in relation to the Lebanese people and \"Israel\" on the other side, there is a resistance in Lebanon - a serious resistance that does not have time to joke, to have fun, or to waste. It does not have an annual vacation. It is a resistance that works day and night. It thinks, plans, follows up, and studies all the new developments. It scrutinizes all the developments of the capacities of the enemies and the developments in the region. It reprograms and reconsiders incessantly its plans, programs, and structures. It trains and arms with the best kinds of arms it can obtain - and this is its natural right. It always makes serious, honest, and transparent updates. When it is engaged in a battle, it evaluates it, and it benefits from the experiences and lessons and accordingly takes the appropriate stances, just as what took place days ago in the Arsal and Flitah Outskirts. You have this serious resistance which has these men, capacities, and abilities. The enemy knows that this is its problem - this is the resistance whose value and importance we must know.\r\n\r\nWe are here also before a human value. This resistance is characterized by loyalty, honesty, and work aimed at achieving major and national goals. It does not search for personal benefits or partisan interests or factional profits. Days ago, I was reading (the words of) one of the politicians in Lebanon. The man is quite respectable. He has a good intellect. He said: \"We fear that after the battle in the Arsal and other outskirts comes to an end, Hezbollah will demand an amendment to the quotas in the Lebanese factional system, requiring a greater quota for the Shia\". Here I am reassuring him. We did not do that in 2000; we did not do that in 2006; now we will not do that (either); and we will not do that after we are through in Syria. I will talk about Syria in a while. The humane and moral characteristic of this resistance is that it puts national aims before its eyes, and it works to achieve these goals. It does not seek political profits as is the Lebanese way of things. Not at all! This is its primary value which must be comprehended, safeguarded, and protected. This must not be feared, it must rather be the haven to which one resorts, is assured by, and depends on. Moreover, the power of this resistance after the July War and today is becoming more and more powerful. They wanted to crush it in July 2006 but since August 14, 2006 - like tomorrow - till our day, its power is increasing. I am not exaggerating. This is what the enemy is saying, this is what is acknowledged by the antagonist, and what is known by the friend.        \r\n\r\nThe hopes of everyone who bet on crushing the resistance in the July War were lost. Today, the hopes of everyone who bet on crushing the resistance by hitting its axis in the region was lost and is lost, and all their hopes will be lost God willing, based on this development and growth in power. This is the importance of this point. \r\nNow allow me between parentheses to say that when I talk about the resistance and the enemy, I am not sending internal messages. I am not addressing the interior, and I have no business with internal antagonisms, internal considerations, and internal grudges - meaning the internal Lebanese politics. The enemy reached a conviction - not now but since 2006 - which is growing with the development of the resistance. This conviction is expressed in the specialized studies and the statements of current and former officials and leaders. Moreover, a general conviction and a general culture are now being formed among many of the \"Israelis\". This conviction is the following: Any war on Lebanon - because now they do not talk about a war on Hezbollah, they rather talk about a war on Lebanon - no matter what its targets are, it is not worth or is not equivalent to the costs which \"Israel\" would bear in such a war. The costs will be huge for the enemy - this is what the enemy is saying - and its state, people, and army. Some say the costs are unsustainable, and consequently, there are broad and wide calls in the enemy entity - even among the most extreme politicians and military men - to evade going into any war with Lebanon for whatever reason or under any condition. They say war may take place only under one condition, that of having no choice, meaning that there is no choice but war. Since when are they that much kind? They are rather saying sit calm. Things are over. The game in Lebanon is over. The story of dispatching a musical band to Lebanon or having a ride is over. The case of the invasion of 1978 and 1982 is over. \r\n\r\nWell, was this conviction born as a result of US pressure, or the international community, or the enemy's respect of international resolutions? There is nothing of this sort. This conviction was born because the \"Israelis\" know for sure - they say that they know that more than the Lebanese know, and this is quite possible - that in Lebanon there is a force which if added and integrated in the golden equation it won't remain a resistance but rather it becomes the resistance-army-people formula. We have witnessed this in the July War. In any war, the cost will be very high on \"Israel\", and it is not known whether it will achieve its goals and make victory. Well, if victory is absolute with a high cost, things would be disputable. But rather they are talking about eventual high costs and a dubious victory. This is what prevents \"Israel\" from staging an aggression against Lebanon. This is what prevents it from staging an aggression on Lebanon in the future. This is what turned our borders, towns, plains, and valleys into safe places. \r\n\r\nThis is the power which as I said we must guard and protect. The enemy takes this force into consideration. When we guard this force as Lebanon and as Lebanese, and when this power is complemented via the people-army-resistance equation, walls will be raised higher in the \"Israeli\" entity, and fears will grow more and more among the \"Israelis\", and the \"Israeli\" deterrence from staging any aggression against Lebanon will also grow. The world will respect you because - brothers and sisters and respected people - we are living in the world of wolves. We are living in a world in which the bones of the weak are crushed. We are living in a world which recognizes only the strong. So only as such will the world respect us, and only as such will the enemy respect us and take us into consideration. \r\n\r\nWe will give you a simple and new example. Some time ago we talked about the ammonia tank in Haifa. Indeed there are great economic and commercial interests from the ammonia tank. By the way, it came to be owned by someone from the Trump family - though he is not a kin of the current US president. \r\n\r\nThe \"Israelis\" were stubborn, but after all they reached a (realization) that they have to close the ammonia tank. For a year, they studied the alternatives, the choices, the Negev, and the sea. However, after all the issue was over. Thus after long and wide-ranging discussions, judicial cases, and appeal cases, I read days ago that the court ruled that the Haifa tanks must be closed finally because of the danger it poses, and it will be closed by September 13 and 14, I believe.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIf the \"Israelis\" do not respect you as a resistance, do not respect your word, and do not respect your promise and your intimidation, why do they go into a crisis of this sort? You know it is a matter of millions of dollars - which is the most valuable thing according to the \"Israelis\". That's because they respect you. Why do they respect you? That's because you are strong, and they know that you are capable. Now if they believe that you are weak, should you deliver speeches 300 days a year, should you lose your voice, that would be worthless, and that would go with the wind.\r\n\r\nAs the ammonia tank case is over, we hope God willing that they will reconsider the Dimona nuclear reactor which is more dangerous than the ammonia tank in Haifa, and this must be addressed anyway. \r\n\r\nNow because the enemy knows that a military and security war on Lebanon - a military war in particular - can't achieve its goal to crush the resistance and its cost would be enormous, it must not remain silent on the growth of the power which they talk about daily, thus they resort to other means. What are these other means?\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis issue requires the resistance of the Lebanese. Here I will talk about a collective responsibility. The factor on which the \"Israelis\" bet today is the Trump administration and the pressure this administration would practice to achieve this goal. \r\n\r\nThe Obama administration used to work against us, and it never failed in doing so. Still, they bet that the Trump administration would be tougher and harsher, that the US administration would practice more pressure on Hezbollah, practice pressure on the Lebanese government, practice pressure on the Lebanese people, practice pressure on the friends of Hezbollah and the supporters of Hezbollah, and the masses of Hezbollah, whether in Lebanon or in other states in the region. \r\n\r\nAny person, bank, media outlet, newspaper, political, deputy, or minister who talks kindly about Hezbollah will be confronted with pressure and threats. This is the means available now. \r\n\r\nThey resorted to the US financial sanctions. Efforts are being exerted to confront this issue but it is required (that we all) not submit to it. Here I will jump directly to the conclusion: neither financial sanctions, nor US threats and intimidation, nor all the means available and possible to the US administration can do harm to the force of the resistance, the will of the resistance, and the determination of the resistance, and the growth of the power of resistance in Lebanon.  \r\n\r\nThey are troubling themselves. That does not mean that they stop trying. The financial sanctions are still ongoing. They tighten Hezbollah financially. Should anyone grant and donate money, they will impose sanctions on him, and they started some procedures to this effect. \r\n\r\nWhat is more dangerous and crucial is the psychological pressure and intimidation practiced on states, governments, parties, and personalities, not only in Lebanon but also in the entire region: who contacts Hezbollah? This is a terrorist party? Whoever contacts Hezbollah will be punished and boycotted. This is a supporter of terrorism. So they want to silence everyone.\r\n\r\nThere is something which I postponed talking about the other time. That's when the US president Trump talked about Hezbollah in the presence of the Lebanese Premier as well as the statements made by US officials or secretaries or the UN ambassador. Have you noticed that the successive US ambassadors are all women, and they all overbid Netanyahu? What is the rhetoric they are using? \r\n\r\nFirst, let's comment briefly on Trump's acquaintance and knowledge with the political situation in the region. In fact, the Lebanese media outlets did not make a precise quote. Later the quote was translated with precision. That's when he said that the US and Lebanon are partners in the war on terrorism represented by Daesh and Hezbollah. Imagine that there is a person who does not know that Hezbollah is a partner in the Lebanese government, and (someone who believes) that the US and the Lebanese government are partners in the war on terrorism represented by Daesh and Hezbollah, and he does not know that Hezbollah is in the Lebanese government and part of this government, and he doesn't know that some of its friends in Lebanon claim that Hezbollah controls the Lebanese government - which is merely an invalid fabrication. We never controlled the Lebanese government - neither this government nor the former one nor all the previous ones. He does not know this, and he wishes to lead the battle in the region. Furthermore, I want you to listen to me very well. Second, he does not know that the Lebanese government up until that time had not been engaged yet in a war against Daesh. Well, the security apparatuses are exerting efforts, and the intelligence directorate and the security apparatuses are doing a respectable job. However, the military battle with Daesh up until that time had not started yet. Now the Lebanese government will start in its battle against Daesh in the remaining outskirts in Beqaa. I will tackle this point later. \r\n\r\nLet's put his knowledge or ignorance aside and move to the expressions with which he described Hezbollah. Allow me to talk extensively about Hezbollah because we are on top of the black list. He referred to Hezbollah as a destructive power. So first comes terrorism. Next, it is a destructive power. Third he referred to it as a dangerous power, by saying that Hezbollah poses a danger on Lebanon and the region. \r\n\r\nI want to add one quick comment. You already know what I'm going to say, but I'll just talk about it to show that we've responded.\r\n\r\nFirst as per terrorism, the terrorists are America, \"Israel\", and the groups formed by America and \"Israel\". I've repeated this a hundred times. For one year and throughout his electoral campaign, Trump kept saying that Obama and Hillary Clinton created Daesh. You have created Daesh, and Hezbollah was one of those fighting the terrorists in the region.\r\n\r\nHezbollah is not terrorist. Hezbollah is a force that fights terrorists alongside all those who are fighting it. \r\n\r\nHe said that Hezbollah is a destructive force, a dangerous force. Yes someone could stop at these words and say that the Sayyed admitted that Hezbollah is a destructive, dangerous force. You can take this extract (only), there is no problem. But the continuation of this would be that Hezbollah is a destructive, dangerous force for the \"Israeli\" project (in the region). It was and will always be.\r\n\r\nHezbollah as a basic part of the resistance destroyed, shattered, and smashed the great \"Israeli\" project in 2000. The downfall of the Great \"Israel\" is being proved every day and every time a big wall is raised in Lebanon on the frontiers with Palestine, and every time a wall is raised in the West Bank and Gaza. \r\n\r\nThe Great \"Israel\" has been destroyed, and Hezbollah was a part of the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance in the region which destroyed it. Indeed Hezbollah was part of the regional resistance that destroyed the haughty arrogant Great \"Israel\" in 2006, as did Gaza in its successive wars, the last of which was in 2014. \r\nHezbollah destroyed the \"Israeli\" project in the region, or some parts, alternatives, or options within this scheme.\r\n\r\nIn the July War during which it was the spearhead, Hezbollah was the one that destroyed the \"New Middle East\" - the project of Condoleezza Rice in the region. \r\nThat's right, Hezbollah is destructive and dangerous, but (only) for your schemes, occupations, and hegemony. Now what about you - America and \"Israel\"? \"Israel\" is an entity that occupies and usurps land and commits massacres. It commits terrorism daily in the al-Aqsa Mosque, in al-Quds, in the West Bank, in territories occupied since 1948, in Gaza, and everywhere. You perpetrated all the aggressions, destruction, and demolition, and all the wars waged upon the states, governments, and peoples of the region. You financed and commanded them as well as the wars in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. These are all (the result of) the US and \"Israeli\" will, administrations, and commands. \r\n\r\nSo don't describe others with traits that better describe you.\r\n\r\nHezbollah along with the other resistance groups is a force of goodwill, defense, and protection. It is a force that maintains existence and destroys danger. Therefore, these traits and accusations won't affect our will.\r\n\r\nSo where is this leading to? Whether knowingly or not, when Trump and the Americans talk this way, they actually want to practice pressure on the Lebanese people. Today, we are facing an act of intimidation. I hope that no Lebanese are covert partners in this act of intimidation. This is manifested when someone shows up and says that Lebanon will be facing international sanctions from America, Europe, the Arab world and the Gulf. Woe unto you, O' Lebanon! So, I hope none of the Lebanese are covertly instigating or are a partner in this intimidation. This is intimidation practiced against the Lebanese. We have lived (being subjected to) intimidation since the day we were born. During past decades, we've witnessed a lot of intimidation. The officials in the government are more affected by this intimidation, and I'm talking based on information and facts. This intimidation is found in closed rooms, in diplomatic meetings, and in international visits. There is intimidation, pressure, and threats. Look and make some comparisons, and I urge the Lebanese officials to make this comparison. The \"Israelis\" are saying that they don't want to make war with Lebanon, they don't want to go to war. The costs are high, they are higher than any goal that could be achieved via this war. They say that they only launch war when they have no other choice. But in closed meetings, the Americans and Europeans tell the Lebanese officials that if they don't do so and so, then \"Israel\" will wage a war on Lebanon, or that if Hezbollah doesn't do such and such, then \"Israel\" will declare war on Lebanon. How is that possible?\r\n\r\nI say that we should be strong. Once we're psychologically strong, we'll be practically and eventually strong, and we will be strong in the field. Strength starts from within. Everyone should know that strength is born inside, and it is not the weapons, tanks, missiles, planes, or the number of your army that matters. What matters is who you are. What does your will, state of mind, soul, intellect, determination, preparation, courage, firmness, dignity, honor, and saving your face mean to you? When we're strong from within, we should not be scared of anything. Aren't we in the era of victory? The era in which the \"Israeli\" threatens and implements his threats has long gone. The tables are turned. \r\n\r\nI will make a nice digression here. I'm not saying hypotheses, I'm just stating what happened. If an environmental or agricultural association, or a municipality in the South planted a green tree on the frontiers, \"Israel\" would file a complaint to the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council against Lebanon. What is the complaint, they would ask. They're planting trees on the frontiers. What is the problem? They would say that the UNIFIL went and saw the tree, any they didn't find any explosive device or camera or weapon. Unless they tie the green color of the tree to the military uniform, then they are right, that could be a violation, for example. \r\n\r\nWhy is it so? Today, the \"Israelis\" are afraid of our trees on the frontiers because they think that trees protect our country, our villages, our people, and those who will face their aggression should they choose to attack. Thus they want to have trees while they wish for us to be in a desert. This applies not only to nature but rather to everything.  They want to have knowledge and to leave us in ignorance. They want to own a nuclear weapon while we are not to be allowed to own a missile or a machine gun. They want to have technology while we go back and ride on donkeys and camels. They want to stay above trees and greeneries while we stay below in a barren land. Should we accept that? After all that we've been through, we, the Lebanese people, should not accept that. \r\n\r\nAlright, today they object to the tree. Now should a young Lebanese man not wearing military attire go up and walk along the frontiers and look in the direction of Lebanon, that would not be considered a violation of Resolution 1701. But should he stand at the barbed-wire fence and look in the direction of Palestine, he would be violating Resolution 1701. They would talk to the Security Council to charge the UNIFIL to inspect this problem which needs to be resolved. No young Lebanese man should look in the direction of Palestine when walking on the barbed-wire fence. Why? Because he would be exploring and gathering information. On the other hand, the \"Israelis\" have the right to install cameras, radars and piloted aircrafts every day and every hour in Lebanon's sky, and it would not be a violation. But when a young, civil, Lebanese man, whether he belongs to the resistance or not, stands on the frontiers and looks in the direction of Palestine, that would be considered a violation of Resolution 1701. Who do they complain to? They would complain to the Security Council, and they already did. We've complained to the Security Council for 60 years but it was in vain. So go and complain. We are going to keep planting green trees on the frontiers. The municipalities will, and so will the associations and the people. Not just the municipalities and the associations should plant trees, I also urge the people of South, of western Bekaa, of Baalbek-Hermel, and of the eastern and the western mountain ranges to plant trees wherever there are mountains and frontiers. This is a part of the resistance. This is a part of protecting Lebanon. So plant trees and don't wait for the government, the ministry, the associations, and the institutions to do it. Each person should plant trees around and in front of his house and in his garden. This protects our country on the security and military level. So besides being good to keep the environment green, trees have other benefits.  \r\n\r\nToday, the \"Israelis\" have the right to do whatever they want with the settlements. They can build high passages and install radars on them. However, if a front-lying village builds a water tank which is a bit high, the UNIFIL climbs up the tank to make sure no cameras are installed or to see if they are spying on \"Israel\". They tell the \"Israelis\" that there are no cameras, yet still the \"Israelis\" would keep thinking what would become of this tank in the case of war. \r\n\r\nThis is excellent. This feeling reflects weakness. When the \"Israelis\", who never took Lebanon seriously and always underestimated Lebanon and its people and everything inside it, reach a state in which they fear the tree on the frontiers and in villages and fear the water tank and the young man walking on the barbed-wire (fence) looking at Palestine, it means that they hit rock bottom, even if they have a tremendous armed force. That's because their psyche is in a state of weakness and feebleness. When our people have the courage to build their homes near the barbed-wire, plant trees, and walk in the middle of the night along it, and when they work in their fields and plains, that means that we've reached the peak of our psychological power, apart from our military force.\r\n\r\nThis is what they want us to compromise today. This is why I urge everyone to confront and resist them. They can't do anything about it. If anything, they will practice pressure. But there are lots of obstacles that will not allow them to be successful in this file and in this regard.\r\n\r\nWell, now we reach the second last section. From July 2006 to July 2017, we witness a new victory in another battle, which is nevertheless linked to the very first battle. It is the victory which was achieved weeks ago in the Arsal and Flitah Outskirts. We witness the same norms and standards and considerations. Why am I saying the same battle? Look at the \"Israelis\". They are the most saddened side by what took place in the Arsal and Flitah Outskirts. The \"Israelis\" are the saddest side. As for those in Lebanon, I had said let's not say who was saddened and who was not. I am talking about the \"Israelis\"; the \"Israelis\" got sad - very sad. What took place in Syria made the \"Israelis\" very sad. \"Israel\" is weeping over the terrorist and Takfiri groups upon which \"Israel\" bet in Syria and which have started to lose now. \"Israel\", along with the US, is expressing its frustration, especially in relation to Daesh. The \"Israelis\" are exerting efforts and are still exerting efforts along with the US administration to the effect of preventing the defeat of Daesh in Syria. That's because the defeat of Daesh in Syria means the victory of Iran, President Bashar al-Assad, and Hezbollah in particular. The \"Israelis\" are keen that Daesh, al-Nusra, and the armed groups gain victory in Syria. In fact, the \"Israelis\" have ties with these armed groups which they support, finance, and arm. They also submit their wounded into their hospitals and provide their militants with information. Furthermore, if the armed groups feel uncomfortable in southern Syria, the \"Israelis\" interfere and back them with artillery shelling and airstrikes. Thus this battle is an extension of that very battle. \r\n\r\nWell, I have three quick points under this topic. \r\n\r\nFirst, it is assumed that tomorrow or the day after - within a few days at most - the remaining militants should quit the Arsal Outskirts and head into Syria - based on the facilitations thankfully offered by the Syrian leadership as usual. The Lebanese Army took the decision to deploy in that area - and this is a popular request. Consequently, what remains of this area in the Arsal Outskirts and along the confrontation line with Daesh from the side of Arsal will be in the hands of the Army. Once the Army goes up and sets up bases, we will withdraw and give them the area. Hereof, I am informing the residents of Arsal that henceforth, they can go and contact the Army - indeed in what falls in line with its new condition. Still, these are your rights, orchids, trees, and quarries. Trust in Allah. The days that separate you from that are but few. \r\n\r\nThe second point has to do with what we are up to. Indeed not only we in Lebanon but also Syria is awaiting the decision to be taken by the Lebanese Army command which is the side which will decide the time of the new battle to liberate the rest of the Lebanese outskirts and on the other side, liberating the Syrian outskirts from Daesh. \r\n\r\nThe decision is final. There were attempts to frustrate the Lebanese from moving along in this decision, but Lebanese President Michel Aoun's call for the Higher Defense Council to meet and the consultations that took place there finally settled on this choice. We can say with pride that today we have a true national, political, sovereign decision, which is not submissive to any external considerations, to liberate a part of the Lebanese land which is occupied by Daesh - this Daesh which the whole world, the friend and the foe, unanimously agree is a terrorist organization. Consequently, the decision is final. This stage is over. The timing is in the hand of the Army. Everyone is waiting, and things will move in the right path God willing. \r\n\r\nHere I have a request because people started tackling this point. I hope that no one will make a mistake and put a timetable for the Army on this front and on that front. Let no one say it is required that the Army settle the battle in two days or seven days. Why? I also hope that no one will make comparisons between this battle and that battle. Put grudges and machinations aside. We are now heading towards a national battle in which blood is to be shed - the blood of the young men in the Lebanese Army and the resistance and the Syrian Army....It is not time for overbids. At least no one in our political and media side must try to score and make records. You know that our coalition is wide. We don't want anyone from the March 8 bloc to say that the Army is late in putting an end to the battle, the resistance ended the battle in a couple of days. This is nonsense. Let no one put a time table for this battle. Let them fight at ease. Let no one compare between battles. Every battle has its own conditions and facts and difficulties. However, I like at the end of this point to say that God willing we will be before a final victory. The victory will be achieved God willing. As for Daesh, they will be defeated and they will flee. This is for sure. That is if no other solutions were sought. So it is only a matter of time and a matter of dealing with a national and humanitarian spirit with the upcoming battle which is to the interest of everyone. \r\n\r\nThe third point in the second last section has to do with the discussions taking place in Lebanon. We have witnessed arguments pertaining to coordination between the Lebanese and Syrian armies unfortunately this week and in the past ten days at most: shall the ministers go to Syria or not? Shall we coordinate with the Syrian government or not? There are well known political forces in Lebanon which have sharp stances as per this issue, though it is not we who evoked this argument in the government to cause a crisis - others evoked this topic to make a crisis. We do not want to make a crisis. Ministers used to go to Syria always. This is not the first time, this is not something new. However, I want to talk about more than coordination between the two armies in the upcoming battle and more than whether this minister will go to Syria or not. I want to address these political forces which have a sharp stance in a calm, responsible way: listen to me and reconsider things. The scheme you bet on in Syria collapsed, and it is about to come to an end. It is clear that the scheme you bet on and are still betting on in Syria collapsed or is in the last stages of collapsing. Wherever you are now in Lebanon - whether in the city or the village or the mountain or the valley as it is summer now - make your contemplations and reread the developments that took place in Syria and the region. See the facts and take stances accordingly. \r\n\r\nFirst: put the grudge, dreams, hopes, desires, and expectations aside. Take the facts, analyze them, and take the decision accordingly. Facts say that Daesh is a matter of time in Syria. It is a matter of time in Iraq. The decision to eliminate Daesh is final. Daesh will not find anyone to defend it in the world after all the atrocities, crimes, and massacres it perpetrated against Islam, divine religions, and all people. \r\n\r\nSecond: the armed opposition is in its worst conditions, and in most places it is besieged. \r\n\r\nThird: the political opposition is weak from the very beginning, and now it is becoming feebler following the political crisis between the Gulf and Qatar. \r\n\r\nFourth: the new administration in France, which was most fanatic and extreme about Syria, now recognizes President Bashar al-Assad as the legitimate president of Syria. \r\n\r\nFifth: one after the other, the Gulf States started pulling their hands (out of Syria). Now wait for more. Later, this will blame that, and that will blame this. This is what we will see in the future. I am talking facts and not predictions.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Americans announced that the groups they funded, trained, and bet on failed, are hopeless, and may be dangerous, thus they stopped supporting some of these groups. \r\n\r\nAmerica today is negotiating with Russia over its interests and the interests of \"Israel\" in Syria. This is America. They know that the game is over as per America. \r\nThe entire world is now acting on the basis that this regime will remain, that this army will remain, that this state in Syria and its institutions will remain. Some time ago, they used to believe that these are over. They were still arguing on the president. But now, everyone is acting and telling the opposition in closed sessions: act as if President Bashar al-Assad will remain in office. A political settlement will be reached in Syria. How will the \"moderate opposition\" - if it exists - find a way to be in power and be a partner in the political authority? This is the information and facts of the closed sessions - most of which are now reported by media outlets. \r\n\r\nTo return to the concerned officials in Lebanon, I tell them reconsider this issue very well. I do not want anyone to rejoice at the misfortune of others. I do not want anyone to open up accounts with anyone else. Let's see what the interests of Lebanon in all of this equation are. We are talking about the interests of Lebanon. Let's put the interests of Syria aside. We are with them to achieve the interests of Syria. \r\n\r\nIn fact, these opposing and reserved political forces can't help Syria whatsoever. Neither your recognition makes any difference, nor does your normalization make any difference. Now, there is no need for such negative rhetoric. Let's talk about the interests of Lebanon.\r\n\r\nGeographically speaking, besides the sea, Lebanon has common borders with Palestine which is occupied by \"Israel\", and Syria. By reason of geography and history, the interests of Lebanon with Syria are by far more than the interests of Syria with Lebanon. This is nothing new in Lebanon. Even now, in all or most of the files, we - Lebanon - need to contact Syria. Lebanon needs that. \r\n\r\nI can give many examples. For example, when the border is liberated, the army wants to go and deploy there. How is it to deploy on both sides? Are we to talk with the Americans? How shameful! They agree to sit with the \"Israelis\" in Naqoura. They agree to sit with the \"Israeli\" enemy who slaughtered us, killed us, destroyed our country, and waged wars on us, and we say that in Lebanon there is a consensus that \"Israel\" is an enemy - still, they argue whether officers from the Lebanese and Syrian armies can sit to coordinate with each other. It is in the interests of Lebanon that they talk with each other. It is in interests of Lebanon and not the interests of Hezbollah or this party or that movement, or this faction or that sect. Not at all! It is a national interest that they sit and talk with each other. \r\n\r\nIt is in our natural interest that the border between Lebanon and Syria be open. It is our national interest that Lebanon agrees with Syria over agriculture and our products and their products. Our national interest imposes on us to agree with Syria because soon the borders with Iraq will open as well as the borders with Jordan. Then you will want to export Lebanese products.\r\n\r\nIn the past when they closed the borders with Syria, a senior official in Lebanon told me personally that he does not want to talk with the Syrians, he rather wants to transport Lebanese agricultural products via airplanes. What a witty economic mind! Imagine that the Middle East airplanes are transporting potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, and bananas to be sold abroad, because if we do not transport them on board of airplanes we will not find a market for them. But you know already that the cost of labor in Lebanon is expensive. \r\n\r\nWe in Lebanon - all the Lebanese, whether working in agriculture, industry, or trade - need to have ties with Syria. As per the security situation, we need to talk with Syria. As for the oil and gas blocks in the north, you need to delineate the borders to be able to bring companies. You have to talk with Syria. You are ready to talk with \"Israel\", but you don't want to talk with Syria.    \r\n\r\nSo let's put such personal considerations aside, our partisan considerations aside, our grudges aside, and discuss our national interest. This is Syria: its regime, state, and president will remain in office, and it is heading towards a political settlement.\r\n\r\nThe only neighbor for us is Syria because on the other side we have the enemy. What is the interest of Lebanon as per gas, oil, electrical power, agriculture, industry, security, and the borders? Is it in talking with the Syrians or in building barricades and sleeping and dreaming of the projects which fell and collapsed?\r\n\r\nToday, as far as this issue is concerned, we can benefit from the July War. Excuse me, I took much of your time. I still have a few minutes. I thank you for tolerating me, and I apologies for talking for more than an hour. In the July War, there was the resistance. We had the Army too and a popular supporting environment in most of the regions, if we are not to say in all of the regions and among most of the political movements. There was an official solidarity but there was a political gap in the July War. \r\n\r\nAs for political solidarity, His Excellence President Emile Lahoud was heading the cabinet and leading a battle along with the rest of the ministers. In the political, negotiating, media, popular, and military battle, we had a full partner named Speaker Nabih Berri. \r\n\r\nFrankly speaking, we had a gap which is the Premiership and the formation of the government. You know that, I am not attacking anyone. The battle was in the government. \r\n\r\nDespite this official and popular gap, we could gain victory over an enemy of this magnitude. Well, perhaps this word is a bit heavy for them. Let's say we could frustrate the goals of the aggression.     \r\n\r\nToday, we have a new experience under the new President, the old-new Premier, and the Speaker - may Allah prolong his life span and the life spans of everyone God willing. We have a national conviction, and we will make use of this atmosphere prevailing now in the Arsal Outskirts. We do not want to invest the atmosphere now prevailing in the Arsal Outskirts for partisan benefits. Let's invest this atmosphere for national interests and for talking about national interests. Why should anyone be afraid? No one must be afraid should we have ties with Syria. Let's talk with Syria, negotiate with Syria, and coordinate with Syria. This is in the interest of Lebanon. We can all talk with each other and cooperate to achieve it.\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the victory of rightfulness over injustice in July 2006 and the victory of blood over the sword, allow me to tackle a point outside of the battle with \"Israel\", though in fact it is within it. Allow me to mention the worst humanitarian catastrophe, which is taking place in Yemen.  \r\n\r\nThe United Nations is saying that currently the worst humanitarian catastrophe is that which is taking place in Yemen. Thousands are dying from cholera. Hundreds of thousands are infected with cholera. Millions are threatened of dying by hunger. What is the reason? That does not need much wit...the reason is war and the siege. Who is waging the war and imposing the siege? They are America, Saudi Arabia, and their allies. \r\n\r\nTo stop this humanitarian catastrophe, the whole world must call on America and Saudi Arabia to stop the aggression and war on Yemen lift the siege imposed on it. In my own viewpoint, all those who are silent in the world are held responsible. Should America and Saudi Arabia hear all world governments, states, parliaments, parties, scholars, movements, forces, and media outlets calling on them to stop practicing this terrible, loathsome aggression on this people, they would have at least thought of stopping the war. \r\n\r\nA global, Arab, and Islamic call is required. Otherwise what would a condemnation from here and a description from there do while the catastrophe is continuing, mushrooming, and worsening every day in Yemen?  \r\n\r\nOn this day, we are supposed to say this rightful word though it may disturb some people. Apart from all considerations, this is a humanitarian stance and a moral stance. Stop this war. Lift the siege. Treat the Yemenis for cholera. Stop the outbreak of Cholera. Stop the famine. Look for a political solution. The political solution is always possible and available, however, there are always sides which want to humiliate others and impose their conditions on others.  \r\n\r\nO' brothers and sisters! As we will soon be marking the sad anniversary of our absented Imam Sayyed Mousa al-Sadr and both his comrades on August 31, we salute this Imam who launched the resistance movement and revived in us the spirit of resistance and the culture of resistance. He consecrated in our culture the cause of al-Quds and the al-Aqsa Mosque. He is the Imam of coexistence and transcending sensitivities and personal, factional, sectarian, and partisan considerations. He is the Imam of honesty, faithfulness, and loyalty to the homeland, sanctities, and the nation. We greet, highly esteem, and express our gratitude to the teacher, the inspirer, and the master and tell him we are all your sons and daughters and your men and women. We will move along on your path and realize all your dreams God willing, and the victory of July 2006 is no more than one of the fruits of the seeds you planted.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings, and may you be blessed every year.\r\n\r\n"},

He said that imbalances in China-US trade are mainly the result of global industrial trends, as well as disparities in the two countries' economic structures and development.\r\n\r\nHe also called on Washington to help alleviate bilateral trade imbalances by easing restrictions on technology exports to civilian users in China, and improving the investment climate for Chinese businesses in the US.\r\n\r\nZheng's remarks came a day after China's Foreign Ministry confirmed that Xi and Trump would hold their first meeting on April 6-7 at the US president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.\r\n\r\nAfter the Chinese announcement, Trump suggested that he would press Xi hard on trade-a centerpiece issue of his presidential campaign.\r\n\r\n\"The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one,\" Trump tweeted late Thursday. \"We can no longer have massive trade deficits ... and job losses. American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.\"\r\n\r\nChina has pushed for a two-way summit for several weeks, hoping that it would set bilateral relations on a more stable footing, diplomats say. On the campaign trail and as president, Trump has sharply criticized China on trade and security issues, including allegations that Beijing hasn't done enough to curb North Korea's nuclear program.\r\n\r\nThe Trump administration has been contemplating measures to counter what it describes as unfair Chinese trade practices. US officials are preparing a review of China's \"market-economy status\" under the World Trade Organization, in a process that could keep Chinese goods eligible for higher US tariffs well into the future. \r\n\r\nBeijing has been particularly concerned about the prospects of a trade war, based on the Trump team's pledges to eliminate the $500 billion US trade deficit-the bulk of it with China-and to label Beijing a currency manipulator, an allegation that Chinese officials deny.\r\n\r\nChina has \"no intention of stimulating exports through competitive currency devaluation,\" Zheng said at Friday's briefing. \"That's not our policy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"},

It has put its nuclear program under enhanced international monitoring as part of the nuclear deal. And Iranian compliance with the deal has been consistently verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Yet, the United States, a party to the agreement, has attempted to portray Iranian missile tests as a violation of the resolution.\r\n\r\nWhile it has failed to get other countries on board, in main part because the text of the resolution is unambiguous, Washington has not stopped claiming that the Iranian missile program breaches Resolution 2231.\r\n\r\nSuch claims, Qassemi said in his Monday presser, were \"unwarranted\" and were \"often made because of... [the accusers'] ill will toward Iran's might, particularly its defensive power.\"\r\n\r\nResponding to a question about the potential violations of the nuclear deal by the US, Qassemi said Iranian decisions on whether violations had occurred rested with the high-level Supervisory Board that has been formed to monitor the implementation of the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action [JCPOA].\r\n\r\nHe said decisions in that regard were technical and the Supervisory Board would be making relevant comments in the due time.\r\n\r\nIran and the P5+1 countries [Russia, the US, the UK, China, Britain, and France] reached the JCPOA on July 14, 2015 and began implementing it in January 2016.\r\n\r\nIran has been complaining that the US, under the administration of its new president, has been seeking to sabotage international trade with Iran.

He's been working on projects.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York Times, however, cited a person close to Bannon as saying he had submitted his resignation on Aug. 7 and that it was to be announced this week, but had been delayed by the fallout from a rally by white nationalists in Virginia over the weekend.\r\n\r\nBannon damaged his standing by giving an interview to the liberal American Prospect this week in which he was seen to be undercutting Trump's position on North Korea.\r\n\r\nBannon told associates he thought he was talking to an academic and thought he was off the record.\r\n\r\nA champion of economic nationalism and a political provocateur, Bannon, 63, is a former US Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker and Hollywood movie producer.\r\n\r\nBannon also spearheaded Breitbart News website's shift into a forum for the \"alternative right,\" a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.\r\n\r\nBannon's current ouster comes with Trump increasingly isolated over his comments in the aftermath of white supremacist violence in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville.\r\n\r\nTrump said on Tuesday the anti-racist demonstrators were as responsible for the violence as the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests. On Thursday, he decried the removal in numerous cities of \"beautiful\" monuments to the pro-slavery Civil War Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThose remarks sparked rebukes from fellow Republicans, top corporate executives and some close allies even as some supporters, including vice president Mike Pence, stood by Trump.\r\n\r\nUnder pressure from moderate Republicans to fire Bannon, Trump declined to publicly back him on Tuesday, although he left his options open. \"We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\" he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York.\r\n\r\nBannon had been in a precarious position before but Trump opted to keep him, in part because his chief strategist played a major role in his 2016 election victory and is backed by many of the president's most loyal rank-and-file supporters.\r\n\r\n"},

He is now expected to use it as a platform to blast those within the White House - and perhaps Trump himself - when they don't hew to the fiercely nationalist policies Bannon advocated as an inside adviser. \r\n\r\nAs Trump's chief strategist, Bannon fought numerous battles with senior Trump aides and top Republicans in Congress over the administration's policy agenda. \r\n\r\nBreitbart frequently backed him up, ripping establishment Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, blaming them for obstructing Trump's agenda. \r\n\r\nMore recently, the site trained its fire on Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, after he removed officials who espoused Bannon's foreign-policy world view. \r\n\r\nIn recent days, Bannon had told friends he is worth tens of millions of dollars, is a worldwide leader in the populist-nationalist movement that propelled Trump to power, and could go back to Breitbart, which he refers to as a \"killing machine\", or perhaps other endeavors financed by the family of hedge-fund tycoon Robert Mercer, his longtime ally.\r\n\r\n"},

They only enrich the Cuban regime.\"\r\n\r\nThe policy changes announced were partial, but Trump tightened rules for American nationals traveling to Cuba, banned ties with a military-run tourism firm and reaffirmed the existing US trade embargo.\r\n\r\nReacting to Trump's move in the Friday statement, the government of Cuban President Raul Castro decried the \"hostile rhetoric that recalls the time of open confrontation\" and \"return to the coercive methods of the past.\"\r\n\r\nTrump's policy rollback also drew criticism from Venezuela, which is Cuba's main ally in the region.\r\n\r\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose country has also been hit by harsh US economic sanctions, denounced Trump for opening a \"new cycle of aggression\" against Cuba.\r\n\r\nCuba \"is not alone,\" Maduro said. \"We reject Donald Trump's declarations against our brother Cuba.

Researchers at Citizen Lab said they confirmed the company's role there by scouring Bahrain's internet space for Netsweeper installations and trying to access blocked sites from a server in the country.\r\n\r\nThe researchers drew on clues such as lines including the words \"Netsweeper\" or \"netsw\" returned during internet scans and a tell-tale line of code in the web addresses thrown up by blocked sites.\r\n\r\nBased at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, Citizen Lab has made a specialty of exposing the companies behind surveillance and censorship in the Middle East and beyond.

They must be stopped; but who will stop them? We submit that you are uniquely situated to shine the cleansing light of public consciousness.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter further added: \"We respectfully urge you to release the report now, finished or unfinished. We ask you to consider all the victims of state-sponsored, Saudi-financed terrorism, their families and their survivors in the UK and all over the world.\"\r\n\r\nLast year, a long-classified section comprising 28 pages that detailed potential Saudi government ties to the attack but which had not been verified, were finally made public.\r\n\r\nEarlier this spring, a lawsuit was filed in New York on behalf of the families of 850 individuals who were killed and 1,500 who were injured.\r\n\r\nThe suit, which was filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York and will be heard US District Judge George Daniels, seeks unspecified monetary damages and says Saudi supported Al-Qaeda in four critical ways - supporting government-linked charities that ran training camps, directly funding Osama Bin Laden's terror group, supporting the hijackers by providing them with passports and, finally, and providing on-the-ground support to the hijackers in the 18 months leading up to the attacks.\r\n\r\n\"9/11 could not have happened without Saudi Arabia's support for al-Qaeda,\" said lead lawyer Jim Kreindler.\r\n\r\nMany believe Britain and the US share a long history of promoting and using extremists when it has benefited their strategic, economic or military goals.

In the Name of Allah, The Most Compassionate, The Most Merciful. Peace be upon the Seal of prophets, our Master and Prophet, Abi Al Qassem Mohammad, and upon his chaste and pure Household, and upon his chosen companions, and upon all messengers and prophets.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings.\r\n\r\nIn my last speech, I promised to talk after the battle - which was ongoing with the Nusra Front - comes to an end. As we are through with this stage, and have begun a new stage, it became obligatory that I give this speech to clarify some ideas, illustrate the path, and specify some points, and highlight responsibilities.\r\n\r\nFirst, I would like to congratulate the captives who have returned to freedom and to their homeland. I also congratulate and offer condolences to the families of all martyrs - all the families of martyrs - for their dear ones who passed away and reached what no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever felt. Blessed and pleased may they be. I also would like to salute the wounded fighters and the mujahedeen. I ask Allah Almighty to bestow patience on them to bear the pain of their wounds, and we pray for a quick recovery for them. I congratulate everyone in Lebanon and in the region on this victory - the accomplishment of the full victory - in this battle which is over. In particular, I congratulate the mujahedeen who made this victory with their hands, arms, and sacrifices. In parallel, I thank all the Lebanese people who received our freed captives yesterday in Baalbek - Hermel, along the Beqaa, the South, and in the various villages and towns. Special thanks to our people in al-Qaa who from the very early morning embraced, welcomed, offered helped, and were true partners in this achievement. \r\n\r\nBesides moving into the topics of my speech, it is my duty to reassure the rest of the noble families, as we still have bodies of martyrs in the hands of the various armed forces. Indeed, with the Nusra Front there are no more captives - perhaps there is a captive or two. There is a missing brother, we do not know if he was martyred or if he is a captive with Daesh held in the Syrian Desert. In the Desert battle, we have a group of missing brethren regarding whom we do not know so far for sure whether they are martyrs or are still alive. As I know that these hours and these moments are very difficult, especially for the rest of the noble families, I want to assert to you that the specialized sides in Hezbollah are following up this file with utmost precision, loyalty, and honesty. I am personally following up on the file which is an object of care. Let no one of you be hesitant. You must all be sure that we are working day and night on this issue, because this is our religious, moral, and jihadi commitment towards you and towards these patient, noble, and struggling families.\r\nSo we are before a mission which was achieved. There is another mission which was achieved. Thus we are before new missions, new conditions, and new responsibilities. I want to tackle two topics and end up with an issue - an extremely important issue indeed. \r\n\r\nAs per the first topic, I want to tackle briefly what was achieved and the remaining details and following up (certain issues). Moreover, we have to perform our moral duty towards what was achieved. That's because our religion is that of religious fairness. In fact, the divine religion is fairness, and whoever does not thank his fellow beings does not thank the Creator, and with thanks blessings last. So on the one hand, for moral reasons, I want to tackle briefly - not all that took place - but only the important things that took place. On another hand, I will tackle that and accordingly, take the appropriate decision on how to tackle the next stage and to benefit from this experience in the remaining and upcoming files. \r\n\r\nWell, as per the first topic, in my last speech, I told you that night that the military battle reached this point: we are now working on two lines, the field and negotiations. Hours after the speech, complications were resolved. Negotiations advanced, and we were able to reach a final agreement, and this final agreement was implemented. Thus you are acquainted with its details and course of events, and I do not want to take your time with the details of this issue. \r\n\r\nHere allow me from the very beginning to laud the remarkable efforts and strenuous and critical work that were exerted by Major General Abbas Ibrahim. Many thanks and full appreciation and prayers from all of us to him. May Allah grant him more and more success. May Allah open up (resolve) through his hands all the next and upcoming files and issues. \r\n\r\nWell, under this topic, I want to tackle several points:\r\n\r\nThe first point has to do with the Syrian side.\r\n\r\nThe second point has to do with the Lebanese side. Then I will move forward.\r\nFirst, as per the Syrian side, as I said, to be fair and to benefit for the next battle and files, we must not overlook this issue; we must rather talk about it with transparency and clarity. \r\n\r\nFirst, from the very beginning, this battle was backed by the Syrian leadership which offered it all possible facilitations. Now there is the field, and there are the negotiations. When we went to battlefield, the Syrian Army was fighting in the Flitah Outskirts, and we were fighting shoulder to shoulder next to them, and they offered martyrs. The media has not been that fair towards the Syrian Army and its sacrifices on this front because the media was focusing more on the Lebanese Front. Thus we must appreciate the Syrian Army and its sacrifices, martyrs, and the wounded in this battle. However, what is important to draw benefit from for the next battle is to say the following outcome: what helped in putting a decisive end to the battle within a very brief period of time is fighting on two fronts: the Syrian Front in the Flitah Outskirts and the Lebanese Front in the Arsal Outskirts. Consequently, the Nusra Front was fighting on all fronts, which broke up the power of the antagonist enemy and, consequently, swiftly put a decisive end to the battle. \r\n\r\nSo the very important outcome which the Lebanese must know now is that one of the reasons for the swiftness in ending the battle and liberating the Arsal Outskirts is our fighting along with the Syrian Army in the Flitah Outskirts at the same time. \r\nSecond: when things reached that far in the battlefield, and the gate was opened to negotiations, the Syrian leadership gave the preliminary agreement for whatever side that wishes to join in the negotiations to participate in them. \r\n\r\nIndeed, we were contacting them directly. The Lebanese state was the side concerned in the negotiations, and our brethren in the Syrian leadership did not have any problem in that. They facilitated the initiation of the negotiations to the effect that they had no problem in that, and that they would cooperate with the Lebanese to reach the desired result. Otherwise, had the Syrian leadership from the very beginning said no, things are through in the Flitah Outskirts, the Nusra Front is now in the Lebanese outskirts and Lebanese territories, and let the Lebanese resolve their own problems by themselves, and they are not concerned with this file, things would not have moved as they did. However, on the contrary, they did not deal with this issue as such at all. From the very beginning, they acted very positively, knowing that this file means transferring the burden from the Lebanese side to the Syrian side.  You are deporting militants, regardless whether the media reported a right or wrong number for the militants. There is no problem in that. Well, let's say they were 200, 300, or 400 militants, no less and no more - I just dont want to give a precise number and be responsible of what I say. For sure their number is no more than this. However, after all, these are being extracted from among the Lebanese people and placed among the Syrians - in Idlib which is the launching pad for a battle against Aleppo or Hama. In fact, the Syrian leadership acted ethically with this Lebanese file. \r\n\r\nThird: during negotiations, they were not picky as far as formalities are concerned. They did not demand the Lebanese cabinet to convene and officially demand Syrian help in this regard. Never! They did not think of all of these details which some people in Lebanon stop at even at the expense of the blood, pain, and the sufferings of the people. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, they did not put conditions. They said what we ask for in Syria, we ask in Lebanon: transportation means, light arms,  verification means...They did not put any more conditions. They did not even put a ceiling for the number. They did not say we accept a maximum of such and such numbers of militants, displaced, and civilians. They rather let the negotiations move along. Afterwards, we reached an agreement, and they agreed on it without any complications. When we went for implementation, as you saw on TV, the delay took place here. However, when reaching the Lebanese-Syrian borders, from the Lebanese-Syrian borders to the Saan checkpoint in Hama Countryside, which is the last point for the swap operation, things went quickly and smoothly. Moreover, facilitations were offered more than in any operation in the past as you saw on TV. \r\n\r\nThis issue must be mentioned and appreciated, and the Lebanese must see and know that this is how this issue was dealt with. \r\n\r\nThus, I want to list several points that resulted from this issue. First, it is our moral obligation to thank His Excellency President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian leadership, the Syrian officials, the security sides that followed the operation, the Syrian Red Crescent, and all those who were in the field all day and night during the past two or three days to achieve this mission and restore to us our captives whom they received at the Saan checkpoint. \r\n\r\nHere I want to draw the moral from this issue as we drew the moral from the battle in the Flitah Outskirts and the Arsal Outskirts as per the battlefield. The moral I want to draw as per the negotiations is that I want to tell the Lebanese people, Lebanese public opinion, and especially the Lebanese politicians, whether they are official or non-official: let's reconsider this issue for a while. This operation included transporting hundreds of militants and thousands of families. Well, there was no United Nations or the Red Cross. There were no international sides. To the last crossing point for the Lebanese Army in Arsal to the Lebanese-Syrian borders in the Arsal Outskirts and Flitah Outskirts, the guarantee was the Lebanese General Security based on the guarantee given by Hezbollah because our military is present there. Here we are talking about the course pursued by the convoy. There are about 300 kilometers from the Syrian borders to the Saan crossing point. They crossed this distance in the darkness of the night and in daylight from the Lebanese-Syrian borders to the Saan crossing point. For about 280 kilometers or 290 kilometers, the guarantee was the Syrian state or the Syrian regime. By the way, I do not consider the word regime to be negative - it is rather a positive word. The Syrian state or the Syrian regime lived up to all their promises. No one was subject to any harm. It offered them facilitations, and as such the issue was over. \r\n\r\nThis experience comes in the framework of other experiences inside Syria including Madaya and Zabadani, and we are ready to listen to anyone who has anything else to say. The media outlets are available to confirm what we are saying. The Syrian state and the Syrian regime always observe their commitments as per transferring the convoys and the militants based on the set measures and conditions. So there is no danger. Even as per all the settlements and reconciliations, the Syrian state fulfills its promises. In many areas in which reconciliations and settlements took place, people are living in security and peace. The other day, I watched a report on television which shows that Zabadani is again a place for restaurants and parties and a peaceful life.\r\n\r\nSo let no one hide behind this issue. Let no one wait for the UN and wait for a political solution in Syria or the like. What I recommend and call for is: do not deal with such issues as a political issue or a political conflict or a financial file. Rather deal with it as a humanitarian file. Here I reiterate and say again: I call on the Lebanese government to take a responsible stance. Let it act based on the interests of the Syrian refugees and the interests of all the Lebanese people. Go and negotiate with the Syrian government, and you will see that things will move as smoothly according to the required guarantees. They are saying that they are worried, afraid, cautious, and the like.\r\n\r\nWell, now we come to the third point on the Lebanese level. In my previous speech, I talked about parties, political forces, ministers, deputies, media outlets, and media, social, cultural, artistic elites...today, allow me on the Lebanese level to talk about officials from a moral perspective too, because that has to do with the negotiations and accordingly, stances will be taken in the future. \r\n\r\nFirst, I want to talk about His Excellency the President of the Republic in a way that does not embarrass him being in the post of the president. He approved of negotiations taking place, otherwise, Major General Abbass Ibrahim could not have been able to carry out the negotiations without the approval of the President of the Republic at least. The President followed up the negotiations and offered all necessary facilitations to secure their success and assumed every responsibility for that. \r\n\r\nOn other hand, I implicitly know through evidence of his sympathy and love to the martyrs, the wounded, the fighters, and the people who offer sacrifices. What is also important on the official level is the speech he delivered on Army Day in which he considered the lastest victory for Lebanon as being the liberation of a dear area on the eastern border from the clutches of terrorist organizations, besides safeguarding security and peace in it. So a brave president of the republic came to say that this victory is a victory for Lebanon, and this victory liberated the outskirts from terrorist groups, and this victory safeguarded security and peace in that area. So they are a few sentences but taking into consideration the political complications that surround the president of the republic, the stance is very much advanced. Indeed, this is what is expected, and we offer him the highest appreciation.\r\n\r\nSecond: his Excellency the Prime Minister in fact adopted this battle from the very first day and followed its course in the field as we said. He also followed it when we started talking about negotiations and the details of the negotiations. He defended it forcefully, lauded it highly, and confronted steadfastly the sharp tongues because we had already taken our decision, and we were occupied in the battle. The Premier in fact confronted all the sharp tongues, and he dealt with the issue on a sympathetic, political, and humanitarian level, saying that those who are fighting in the Arsal Outskirts are his children, his family, and his people. This is a stance which is always highly appreciated. We were repeating the experience of July and August 2006.\r\n\r\nHere I want to be fair from the very beginning. The Premier from the very beginning approved of the negotiations and agreed that the Major General launch the negotiations. He further offered all the facilitations, and I know that there are things on which he approved that might have caused him some embarrassment, however, he agreed because he cares for the success of the negotiations. Well, someone may say that I am showing very high morals, and he may discuss intentions. Well, let them discuss with us our negotiations; however, we have nothing to do with the intentions of people. Allah knows more of their intentions. Still, when anyone does something rightful, we appreciate his stance and his responsible conduct too. We must be fair to him even if we disagree politically.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he said that Hezbollah achieved something in the outskirts. This is a step forward God willing. That's because were we to take into consideration the stance and the statements of the Future Movement and the Future bloc, we would have been in a totally different place. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the (government) heads and the state acted with responsibility as per this issue, and this led to the full accomplishment of this victory - Praise be to Allah. Now everyone has a percentage or a share in this victory which he can magnify or diminish. There is no problem in that.     \r\n\r\nThere is a third obligation under this topic, as we are talking about morals and offering thanks and appreciation, though some people would try to evade this. We in the Arsal Outskirts and Flitah outskirts, when we fight, we fight with capabilities, ammunitions, and expertise which we received primarily from the support of the Islamic Republic of Iran which never fell short in supporting us. Let the whole world know that when fighting the terrorist groups, it is the generous support of the Islamic Republic of Iran that stands behind us, supports us, and enables us to fight the terrorist Takfiri groups and gain victory over them. Indeed, the Islamic Republic plays other roles in this issue which took place, but we keep it for the coming days in order to benefit from it better later. \r\n\r\nThe fourth point: to complete what took place in the Arsal Outskirts, we still have the transfer of Saraya Ahl al-Sham from Wadi Hamid and Al Malahi and the other families who wish to leave too - the families of the Syrian refugees which are in these camps and wish to move to the Syrian interior within the framework of the Saraya Ahl al-Sham file. We are currently following it up since we wrapped up the previous issue at midnight or early morning. \r\n\r\nThe brethren started working with the concerned Syrian sides which previously gave the preliminary approval to achieve this issue as soon as possible God willing. Those (people) will be transferred to their destination, and they will reach it in security and peace with local guarantees, without the United Nations, the International Red Cross, and all the modifications which some may set. \r\n\r\nThe last point under this topic is the status quo. The area which was controlled by Nusra is liberated now. I do not want to reiterate the achievements. The results of the operation were announced by a statement issued by the Resistance operations room which tackled this issue. So I do not want to reiterate. We are now in the Arsal Outskirts. I said before and I will reiterate now that we are ready to hand over control to the Lebanese Army Command at any time they set without any reservations. We are ready from now and even from before now to hand the entire area which was liberated, all the posts, and all the points. Now I reiterate my belief and advice. We are not tired because we are heading to a new battle which I will talk about in a while. Still, I advise that this procedure take place as soon as possible for the good of the people of Arsal and the people of that area. As such, the people will feel assured. The people of Arsal may as well be able to gather their harvest such as cherry and apricot. They can manage to do that. People may return to their quarries and normal life. This issue is over for us. We have nothing in that area, and we do not want to impose our presence on anyone there, and we do not want to contact anyone there. \r\n\r\nThe residents of Arsal are our dear people, and this is their land and orchids and quarries, and they can go to their quarries. However, it is better that the army takes control of that area. Under the control and care of the army, the state would govern the area there and the movement of the people of Arsal, and this is better and preferable. \r\n\r\nHereof, I want to wrap up the first topic: we are before a mission which was successfully achieved. We are before a major victory, a military victory, and a triumph in the field that yielded important and advanced results. \r\n\r\nThe second topic pertains to Lebanon and what it is coming to and the remaining outskirts that are controlled by Daesh. I will tackle these points for the Lebanese public, which followed the first battle and wishes to follow the coming stage so that the Lebanese will be acquainted and aware of facts and figures. \r\n\r\nWell, first under the second topic, I say that Daesh controls a vast area, part of which is Syrian territory and the other Lebanese territory. Now in the media outlets, you will see the map of the area controlled by Daesh. It is a wide area, and the border is approximately in the middle. Part of the land is inside Syrian territory, and the other part is in Lebanese territory, and it comprises what remains of the Arsal Outskirts - I am not sure if this is precise or not - as well as the al-Qaa Outskirts and Ras Baalbek Outskirts.\r\n\r\nI hope no one will pick on us as per the total area controlled by Daesh. It is approximately 296 kilometers: 141 kilometers in Lebanon and 155 kilometers in Syria.\r\n\r\nThe borders are delineated. The Interior Minister said it is a disputed area. I believe the residents of Arsal disagreed with him in what he said. Should it be a disputed area later, the Syrians will argue with us over the mountains and the orchids. Anyway he corrected his mistake. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the border is clearly delineated. There is no problem whatsoever in the demarcation of the border. It is absolutely clear from both sides. The nature of the topology there is very similar to the Arsal Outskirts and Flitah Outskirts - meaning the previous battle. It has mountains and valleys. Its quarries are less but its topology is tough from both sides. That means that if the Lebanese want to liberate this area, they have to climb upwards, and if the Syrians want to liberate that area, they too have to climb upwards. The peaks and the highlands are controlled by Daesh. In saying this, I am giving you an idea about the geographical nature of the area over which the battle may be waged. \r\n\r\nI said in the previous speech that when we are through with Nusra, we will talk, because I had some information that there is a new inclination as per the area controlled by Daesh. So I did not want to speak beforehand and announce a stance at that time. However now, it is clear in the whole country that the Lebanese Army is the side which will undertake the operation of the liberation of Ras Baalbek and al-Qaa Outskirts - let's say the rest of the Lebanese Outskirts to be precautious in what we say in case the residents of Arsal have a part of land there. This has become clear and overtly announced. All its preliminary measures have started. I want to proceed under this topic based on this fact. Thus I will move forward based on what was said before. Otherwise, concerning Hezbollah, it acts in coordination with the Syrian government. Before starting the operation in the area that was controlled by Nusra (Arsal Outskirts and Flitah Outskirts), we coordinated with the Syrian leadership to fight on both fronts (Nusra and Daesh) to end the armed presence this summer. However, we divided the battle to two parts. The first stage is Nusra, and the second stage is Daesh. Now it is excellent that Lebanon officially took a decision that the Lebanese Army will undertake this mission in the Lebanese territories and on the Lebanese front. That would be a development which may be described as historic and strategic. Whatever you may call it, it is absolutely excellent.       \r\n\r\nSo, I hope no one will believe that he is taking anything which may have been ours. \r\n\r\nLet me first comment on this orientation before moving to the battlefield. In the first place, the Lebanese Army is able to perform this operation no matter what its magnitude is. Some may talk about the ammunition, the arms, the number of soldiers... But I say that with the capacities, arms, number, and the competent command, officers, and soldiers it has, the Lebanese Army is indisputably able to achieve this mission. It does not need the help of anyone. \r\n\r\nWhen we read in some communication means about American help or other aid, my view which I would like to say beforehand is that this is an insult to the Lebanese Army. If the great, competent, brave, Lebanese National Army needs American help from the Americans to liberate 141 kilometers squared, this would be a catastrophe. Well, I am sorry but we have to tackle this issue. \r\n\r\nAnyway, it is excellent that the Lebanese Army took such a decision. Here between parenthesis I would like to say something to all those who evoked this argument. In fact, I do not want to debate; I only want to make a quick comment, and I will leave tackling this issue for later on. Always the problem is not in the military institution or the security institution in Lebanon. Never! The institution is competent, and there are excellent officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is in the political institution and in the political decision. Let's analyse what the Interior Minister was saying yesterday about the operation in the Arsal Outskirts. I do not want to accuse anyone. Indeed, I know this issue.\r\n\r\nWho prevented the Lebanese Army from executing that operation? Is the Lebanese Army capable of performing that operation?\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Lebanese Army is capable of doing so. Is it able to execute the operation in Ras Baalbek and al-Qaa and unable to execute the operation in the Arsal Outskirts? Both operations are the same; perhaps the second is more difficult - or is it the first? I do not know. Military men may decide on that. However, let's say at least they are the same or almost of the same toughness. \r\n\r\nWhy is it that now it is able and in the past it was not? No! From the very beginning it is able; however, the problem is in the political decision and the political institution. The same applies to previous cases when the army was attacked in past years. It is a wonderful coincidence that the same day on which Nusra and Daesh violated all of this area and Arsal, the army, and the security forces, is the very day on which they withdrew defeated. This is one of the blessings of Allah Almighty. When the army was attacked, its vehicles and tanks were hit, and its best officers and soldiers were killed and captured, why the decision was not taken then for the army to assume its responsibilities, no matter who the Premier and the President were at that time - they are concerned in taking the political decision.\r\n\r\nThe question is: who prevented it? Did we prevent them? Did Hezbollah prevent them? Allah Almighty and the army know at that moment who supported them, opened fire on them, and provided cover for them. Some people usually do not like to talk about this.\r\n\r\nHowever, were the decision taken on that day, we were ready to support the army and this decision with our eyes and blood. It is not Hezbollah and it is not we who prevented defending the dignity of the army and the security forces and restoring the officers and the soldiers and that area. Go and inquire about who prevented that. \r\n\r\nA couple of weeks ago who said no? Who prevented? Did we Hezbollah prevent so that all this uproar took place and the decision of war and peace was evoked? Did you take the decision of war and we competed with you on it? Did you take the decision of liberating occupied territories and we competed with you on it? Did you take the decision of liberating the captives and we prevented you and competed with you? Did you take a decision to expel the terrorists who killed your soldiers, officers, and people, and we prevented you?\r\n\r\nAnyway, go and ask who wants to build a state. We have an integrated army, security forces, and institutions. We have a problem in the political decision, the political mind, the political choices, and the official political leadership. \r\n\r\nToday surely we link great expectations to the presence of personalities such as General Michel Aoun as a president, and we consider that to be a great development, and we bet on him on the decisive war on terrorism and the terrorist groups, and that he after all is able to take the state in that direction. \r\n\r\nSo the problem was here, and whoever wants to solve the problem, its solution is here. It is not the story of arms. Give that side arms, and leave the field for it. \r\n\r\nShould we have stepped aside three years ago, the flood of refugees in Arsal was telling the Nusra Front to continue their way to Beirut. This is on social communication sites. Should we have exited from the confrontation, where would the country have been? Forget about us. Go and build a state. \r\n\r\nIf we have the strongest army, the best arms, and the best security apparatuses, yet have a political leadership which is unable to take a political decision, gives consideration to foreign factors more than to internal interests, and cares for a wink from this minister and a wink from that ambassador and at times an article in the New York Times is enough to change the political track, then that won't lead to the building of a state. \r\n\r\nNow let's go back to our main point; I will continue this later. I will also postpone talking about sovereignty, the state, the outskirts, the land, the human being, security, and the people. Its time will come later. \r\n\r\nUnless new decisions arise, since this decision is taken, we are heading towards a battle. The Lebanese Army will fight on Lebanese territories. \r\n\r\nTonight I will popularly and officially announce what we will report to officials. Wherever we are present on Lebanese territories, we - Hezbollah - are at the service of the Lebanese Army and the Command of the Lebanese Army. We are ready for whatever service you need. Stop here! We will stop. Help us here! We will help you. Confront. Erect a confrontation line as the army did in Arsal. We will erect that line. Leave this area for us to act at our ease. We will leave it. Hand us the area. We will hand it. \r\n\r\nWe are with you, next to you, and under your service in whatever you want from us. We want for this battle eventually and emotionally to end in a quick decisive victory God willing, and we are praying that this victory would be achieved with the least human costs because every officer and soldier in the Lebanese Army that is martyred is our brother, son, and dear one. \r\n\r\nThis is Lebanese land, and we have no conditions whatsoever. Our hand is open to the other. \r\n\r\nAs per the Syrian front, it will also be open to Daesh. The Syrian Army and Hezbollah will be on the Syrian front. I said that the area is almost divided equally. Perhaps the confrontation on which fighting will take place on the Syrian front is a bit longer from the confrontation line on which fighting will take place on the Lebanese front. We will fight there, and we will be present there. \r\n\r\nNow let's talk morals and human values. Let no \"political philosopher\" in Lebanon say that the Syrian Army and Hezbollah must not fight on the Syrian front, and that the Syrian front must be silenced. It goes without saying that when there are two open fronts on one area, whether we like it or not, people will coordinate with each other and talk with each other. \r\n\r\nSo do not hide behind your finger. If a \"philosopher\" in Lebanon turns around and says that the Syrian front must remain silent, he would be conspiring against the Lebanese Army, the officers and soldiers in the Lebanese Army, and the people and their sons. Why is it so? That's because if that front is calm and no bullet is being shot and no attacks are being staged, that would mean that Daesh will gather all its forces to fight the Lebanese Army. All its militants and fire would be against us, and we must be cautious with Daesh as it may resort to suicide bombers, and consequently, we will put the Lebanese Army before a costly confrontation. It will gain victory after all, but the confrontation will be costly. So let's put political grudge and annoyance aside and deal morally with this battle. There are people on the other front too who are offering their children and dear ones whether they are Syrians or Lebanese. After all, getting rid of Daesh from these outskirts is a Lebanese and Syrian interest. \r\n\r\nConsequently, the front will be one front. I also want to add that the timing of the front is in the hands of the Lebanese Army in the first place, because on the other front, the Syrian Army and Hezbollah are ready. We were ready after we were through with Nusra. \r\n\r\nWhat postponed the attack is the new development in the form of the Lebanese Army assuming this responsibility over the Lebanese territories. \r\n\r\nShould the front be opened from both sides, that would fasten the victory, and it would make victory be achieved with fewer costs for everyone. Here when we talk about costs, we do not talk about money, arms, and ammunition. We are talking about human beings. We are talking about the best men in Lebanon and the best men in Syria. \r\n\r\nThis is what we are heading for. \r\n\r\nThe last point under this topic before reaching the end is an address to Daesh who are now in these mountains and these outskirts. The leadership of Daesh must know that there is a final decision, and nothing is postponed. The battle is not postponed for the next spring or summer. Perhaps few days separate us from the battle with Daesh. I do not know for sure, because the decision is in the hand of the Army in the first place. However, it must be known that the Syrians took a decisive and final decision, and consequently, Daesh can't remain in the Syrian mountains and outskirts. On the Lebanese level, Daesh will face a battle that will attain national Lebanese consensus perhaps for the first time, and this is more of a miracle. Consequently and apparently, all the Lebanese will stand behind the Lebanese Army - and this is what is taken for granted, and they will offer all the political, media, and field support if that is required to accomplish this mission. I will tell Daesh that the Lebanese and the Syrians will overcome you from all fronts and confrontation lines. In the Arsal and Flitah Outskirts, we were fighting on two fronts. No, they were rather four. Now, we will come from all fronts and confrontation lines, and you will not be able to remain steadfast in this battle.  This battle has no horizons; it is rather a losing battle for you. You are definitely losers, and should you fight, you will be either killed, or wounded, or captured. For this reason, it is better to make good calculations. \r\n\r\nNusra did not listen to what we said, and they tried. Now you can think very well. After all, the door may be open to negotiations, though conditions may be different because there is a central cause represented in the captives from the Lebanese Army soldiers and the Lebanese security forces. \r\n\r\nAnyway, this issue will be addressed in this battle whether through negotiations or through the battlefield, and we will come to know the results. You are before two choices. You have little time; a day or two or three. I am not sure what the Army leadership will decide on. Make your decision. Should you choose the field, the field is ready and its result is final for sure, and as His Excellency the President said on Army Day, Lebanon will be before a new victory too. On the Syrian front, we too will be before a new victory. The issue is now in their hands. \r\n\r\nThe last issue which I want to tackle is political investment. Well, in what does Hezbollah want to invest the battle of the Arsal Outskirts? Make some suggestions on how we may invest our victory in Arsal!!! O my brother! We are defending our land, people, and villages - Muslims and Christians. The investment is that we are doing our obligation towards Allah and our people. We offered all the sacrifices. If there is anything more, tell us about it because you are more expert in investments. If anyone among you does anything of trivial or little importance, he remains fighting for investing it politically for 100 years. We will go back to this later. \r\n\r\nNow we reached the last point which I will tackle tonight. It is an old issue but it was evoked in the cabinet and in some media outlets. It was even leaked on purpose in some media outlets because there are some sides which have the intention to cause sabotage. Consequently, I am concerned in commenting on it. It is the issue concerning Lebanon and Kuwait.  \r\n\r\nThe issue was evoked some time ago, and it is aroused in Kuwait. It is the Abdaly Cell which they called the Cell of Hezbollah. Indeed, the state calls it the Abdaly Cell but there are people in Kuwait - because of some political affiliations, especially those who came to Syria and fought and brought along money, and bought rockets and killed and slaughtered - who have an interest in creating big trouble in the country. Thus they say the Cell of Hezbollah. I want to comment on this issue because it was leaked to the media; otherwise, over the past period of time, we were trying to address the stance through certain means. \r\n\r\nFirst, I want to assert Hezbollah's great care and final assertion for the best relations between Lebanon and Kuwait, between the two states and the two peoples. We acknowledge for Kuwait its support to Lebanon and its good intention when it offered help even after the July War. The stance of Kuwait towards Lebanon was always very good and that is highly appreciated, and we are thankful. \r\n\r\nWe in Hezbollah care for the good ties between the two states and the two people, and we do not want anything to stain these ties, and we do not want any minute details that may harm this relation. We are ready to discuss any ambiguity via diplomatic channels or official channels away from any machination whether in Lebanon or in Kuwait - at the level of some political forces. We also are keen on addressing the latest developments with wisdom and calmness God willing.\r\n\r\nAs per this cause there are two parts. The first part is related to Hezbollah in Lebanon or \"we\" - the Hezbollah whom they talk about. The other part is related to the Kuwaiti brethren - some of them are arrested, and the others are not in custody. They were tried, and the sentences were issued, and they were accused. \r\n\r\nAs per the Kuwaiti brethren, they defended themselves and hired a lawyer. They used the available means to clarify the issue, and consequently, I will not interfere in this except if I was forced to talk about it in the future because I am following up the issue, and I have information to this effect. \r\n\r\nI will rather talk about the part related to Hezbollah. I want to tell the Kuwaiti officials and the Kuwaiti people based on a truth that the whole world knows: in case I want to talk about something, and we are accused, whether that was in an Arab country or in a non-Arab country, I am not afraid of saying the truth. \r\n\r\nIn the past, when one of our brethren was arrested in Egypt, several people suggested that we do not talk or adopt what took place. However, I appeared on television and adopted the incident. I said that this is one of our brethren, and we commissioned him for a mission which was against the law in Egypt. Well, we said that we will see how to address the issue. That was our intention. I would like to remind you that the brethren - one brother - was accused of a conspiracy to topple the regime. \r\n\r\nAnyway, also we declare overtly that we are in Syria. We declare overtly (regarding) whatever place we go, and we are not afraid of that. I have nothing to be afraid of - I only care for national and Arab interests. Accordingly, what is said to the effect that we sent arms to Kuwait is not correct. I do not want to use other descriptions. Let's address the issue calmly. It is not true that we sent arms to Kuwait, it is not true that we have arms in Kuwait, it is not true that we purchased arms in Kuwait and gave them to someone else, it is not true that we smuggled arms to Kuwait. Nothing of this is true at all. \r\n\r\nNow there is an arsenal, and you know the details about it. That is a Kuwaiti affair, and I do not want to approach it now. However, it is not true to say that Hezbollah purchased arms, sent arms, smuggled arms, stored arms, or has arms in Kuwait.         \r\n\r\nSecond: it is being called the Cell of Hezbollah. This is not true. Hezbollah has no cells in Kuwait, and it did not form cells in Kuwait whatsoever. It does not have cells or members in Kuwait within its organization, duties, and work.\r\n\r\nDoes Hezbollah have supporters in Kuwait? Yes, it has supporters everywhere in the world. However, it does not have members, cells, or arrangements, whether they are Lebanese or Kuwaiti. This accusation is not correct. \r\n\r\nIt is really ridiculous that they are accusing Hezbollah of instigating the Kuwaiti brethren or colluding with them to topple the regime. This is similar to the accusation against our brethren in Egypt who were similarly accused of toppling the regime in Egypt. \r\n\r\nThis is groundless. We did not instigate them, and they are not thinking in such a way too. Allow me to defend them. It never crossed the mind of any of those accused - neither the elderly, the young, the scholars, the ministers, the youth, the teenagers, the men, nor the women - to topple the regime or fight the regime, or rebel against the regime or sabotage peace in Kuwait at all, and I bear witness to that before Allah in this world and in the Hereafter. This is my information. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, get me one person who is ready to come and say he came and sat with a Hezbollah member or with me and that we instigated them against the government in Kuwait or the Prince of Kuwait or the officials in Kuwait. On the contrary, we always talk and support a political inclination which comprises participating in the parliamentary and municipal elections, partaking in the government, cooperating with the authority, observing the law, observing the order, national unity, positivity, security, civil peace...\r\n\r\nThis is the true stance. This is the stance of Hezbollah. We never wanted for Kuwait except all that is good, security, peace, and integrity, and all these accusations which were made towards Hezbollah are invalid. Allow me to tell you that these are political accusations, and go and search for those who stand behind them. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I do not want to talk about anyone other than me; if needed, I will talk later about others. \r\n\r\nI hope that God willing this issue will be addressed in Kuwait. I tell you without courtesies that we bet and appreciate the fatherhood of his highness the Prince of Kuwait and his wisdom. I am one of the people who were very much moved when I watched the conduct of His Highness the Prince and how he acted on the day Daesh bombed the Mosque of Imam al-Sadiq (peace be upon him). Thus I hope that Kuwait will God willing emerge from this crisis which is given more than its magnitude. It is used in political liquidations and manipulated for regional considerations. God willing this crisis would end up leading to that which will boost the security, integrity, coexistence, national unity, and sovereignty of Kuwait. \r\n\r\nI reiterate that the big bet is on the fatherhood and wisdom of his highness the Prince in addressing this file. In case there is any ambiguity concerning any point linked to us or to our stance, we are ready - via the means you find appropriate and via the official channels - to clarify this ambiguity and cooperate in any direction for the sake of the welfare of Kuwait and the welfare of Lebanon. May Allah bestow prosperity on you all. \r\n\r\nLet's return to our original issue. Should Daesh act logically, there is a chance. I do not know if that would work out or not. We have to talk with the brethren in Syria to see if that would be addressed or not. That will not be easy too. Anyway, the door is open. Should they choose confrontation, we will head towards a national confrontation which enjoys a national consensus in a noble battle in which we will all gain victory, God willing.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings.\r\n\r\n"},

Nearly 700 prisoners are currently held in administrative detention. Some of them have been held in such detention for up to 11 years.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018Israeli' apartheid regime sentenced Barghouti, a popular figure among Palestinians, to serve five life term in prison over his role in the Palestinian Intifada [uprising], and the \u2018Israel' Prison Service [IPS] placed him in solitary confinement since the initiation of the strike.\r\n\r\nThe IPS has been punishing the hunger-striking prisoners by placing them in solitary confinement and denying them legal visits by their families and lawyers since the strike began on April 17, which also was the Palestinian Prisoners' Day.\r\n\r\nThe UN human rights chief added that according to international human rights law, the right to consult an attorney was a \"fundamental protection\" and should \"never\" be violated.\r\n\r\nHe also said the health conditions of the hundreds of hunger strikers had \"deteriorated significantly.\"\r\n\r\nZeid's comments came as lawyers with the Palestinian Prisoners' Society announced that at least 60 imprisoned hunger strikers in Ohalei Kedar prison had been moved to infirmaries, set up in the prison, for observation. Many of the hospitalized inmates were in serious condition, the lawyers added.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},

Throughout history, many Arab and Islamic countries have been occupied, and the masses have been divided into two paths in order to achieve liberation. Some of them negotiate and trust the promises of enemies, and there are those who resist and remain opposed to this colonizer.\"\r\nHe adds that \"the experience of liberating any part of the Arab land, whether in Lebanon or in the Gaza Strip in 2005, is the best example of the success of the resistance experience in achieving the goals.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, we find that the experience of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and his journey with the negotiations since Oslo in 1993 and until this moment indicate disappointment, failure and shame,\" Zahar says to Al-Ahed news website.\r\n\r\n*Shehab: The liberation of southern Lebanon has been and remains a real inspiration for continuing our battle with the enemy\r\n\r\nFor his part, the leader of the Islamic Jihad movement, Daoud Shehab, said: \"Without a doubt, the Zionist occupation in southern Lebanon was a path that had to end under the steadfastness of the Lebanese people and the Lebanese resistance in defending its land. That is why the Islamic Resistance did not stop there one moment and was determined to regain every atom of soil in southern Lebanon. Indeed, that long path of struggle, jihad, steadfastness and heroism culminated in victory.\"\r\n\r\nShehab stressed that this victory was a lever for the Arab and Islamic nation in general and for the resistance in Palestine in particular.\r\n\r\nHe adds that \"Today and after 17 years of this glorious victory which is dear to our hearts, we salute the brotherly Lebanese people and the Islamic resistance.

Today, this nation has duties to fulfill these hopes. This is what this occasion reaffirms and what we seek to achieve.\"\r\n\r\nThe leader in the \"Jihad\" considered that the most prominent message behind the commemoration of this occasion is to emphasize the continuation of the resistance on the land of Palestine and the continuation of the struggle until regaining our homeland.\r\n\r\n* Abu Zarifa: The liberation of the south of Lebanon is a victory that will be kept in the immortal record \r\n\r\nFor his part, member of the Political Bureau of the \"Democratic Front\", Talal Abu Zarifa, says that what happened in southern Lebanon was a great achievement.\r\n\r\nAbu Zarifa pointed out that this achievement would not have been accomplished without the presence of the resistance, and at heart Hezbollah, which is the spearhead in this clear path.\r\n\r\nHe adds that \"This great victory, which was achieved by the Islamic Resistance, was not only presented to the Lebanese people but to the entire Arab and Islamic nation and to all the free people of the world. It gave a clear message that \u2018Israel' with all its potential is defeatable if all elements of the regional power were gathered and united in a resistance front.\"\r\n\r\nHe carries on saying, \"It is not farfetched for the Palestinian resistance to achieve victory over the Zionist entity. It has done it more than once in Gaza because of this endless support by the brothers and the Mujahideen in Hezbollah and the regional powers represented by Iran as the incubator of this resistance project.\"\r\n\r\nAbu Zarifa stresses that this victory will remain preserved in the immortal record, and will remain a source of hope for the people who are struggling to get rid of the occupation no matter how long.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},

However, it recorded via the detained men and women heroic epics of great patience, unmoved perseverance, and loyal adherence to the resistance, and refusal of occupation, humiliation, and disgrace, despite the great sufferings which these captives met in this detention center. This epic of suffering and heroism must be part of the educational curricula to be taught in schools for the generations to come. \r\n\r\nKhiam and the other frontal border towns, as well as the towns deep in the interior, fought for 33 days and remained steadfast despite thousands of aerial bombings and artillery shelling and incessant advance attempts to occupy and control them. Still they remained steadfast.\r\n\r\nThe eye of the enemy was on Khiam for its value in terms of morale and its geographic position which is decisive in the battle. Still, the resistance men in the town and the residents who remained in the town with them fought as the residents of the other towns on the barbed wire line fought, recording marvelous legends of heroic steadfastness and perseverance.\r\n\r\nMost of the town was destroyed but it was reconstructed, as here in Lebanon there is the will of resistance, steadfastness, construction, revival, and life - a life with dignity and pride. This is an expression of the adherence of this great people to their land, villages, hills, fields, and valleys, which this people will never abandon.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNow we return to the Plain. Years ago, we marked the anniversary of the July War in Wadi al-Hujeir.  No doubt Wadi al-Hujeir was a Merkava massacre. The \"Israelis\" too talk about a Merkava massacre in Wadi al-Hujeir. Khiam Plain comes as number two. It follows Wadi al-Hujeir, and it is called the \u2018Merkava conflagration'. It is enough to read the text of the commander of the battalion which entered this plain. He and the commander of the squad above him thought that Khiam is a besieged, destroyed town, and that this plain is empty and that no one in it will resist. There is no possibility for resistance in it. They thought that it would be an easy operation and victory such that it is realized and final. However, read the \"Israeli\" text. The head of the battalion says: \"Here it is difficult to find an expression better than geese under fire.\" So it is as if there is a group of geese or ducks and the hunters are opening fire on them. Imagine the scene depicted by the head of the battalion: \"The tanks were under fire. Merkava tanks and Puma vehicles were being directly hit. One of the soldiers was killed. The engineering battalion commander was directly hit. As such the force dispersed all over the valley, whereas the panic-stricken soldiers (who like mice were hiding in their vehicles) got out of the vehicles and hid inside the area\".   Indeed, several tanks were destroyed, and this is documented, and the footages are available. Several tanks were burnt, and several tanks fled. He also said that two tanks fell in water canals. I don't know which water canal. I am not there to go and search in which canal the tanks fell. He added: \"The tanks drowned, and their muzzles sunk too, which made it very difficult to rescue them\". Later on, the commander of the Northern Area talks with the commander of this battalion and tells him: \"You have to end this mockery which you staged and withdraw. Enough with the idea of controlling Khiam!\" He added: \"A few Hezbollah soldiers made a full military battalion lose their way and get perplexed using the simplest fighting concepts.\"\r\n\r\nO brothers! The story is not that of numbers and tanks. The story is about men. A few men remained in the plain despite thousands of \"Israeli\" raids and thousands of artillery strikes, and the horror of the advance of a full military battalion. Still they remained steadfast like the deep-rooted mountains. They do not get shaken or unsteady. On the other side, a battalion of the \"Israeli\" army, when it gets hit with some anti-tank missiles, flees like terrified mice in the area. This is the formula that prevailed in the July War. Here you find the resistance man who believe in Allah and his cause, rights, path, and resistance. This is the truth of these men whom we call the men of Allah. The men of Allah believe in Allah and work to achieve His content; they love Him and adore meeting Allah. On the other side, you find those who falsely claim to be the worshippers of Allah, to the exclusion of mankind. They do not wish for death, they rather love life even with humiliation, fleeing, and hiding. This is the main lesson for today. \r\n\r\nThe sample presented by the resistance in Khiam Plain, Wadi al-Hujeir, and all the other plains, hills, mountains, and valleys in the south, is the very sample (present today), with the exception that it is much more developed and advanced. It is advanced on all levels, whether regarding quality, quantity, and type. It is developed on the level of men, fighting expertise, fighting types, and the kinds of capabilities. Any \"Israeli\" land troop which may enter our land, mountains, valleys, or hills, will not be met with a sample of the Khiam Plain or Wadi al-Hujeir of 2006. That would be a hundred times more advanced. This is the truth which awaits them. The defeat, the humiliation, and the shame which were afflicted on them in that war would be tenfold in any future war. \r\n\r\nBrothers and sisters! Eleven years have passed on the war which we are marking victory in, (a war) which the \"Israelis\" call the Second Lebanon War. Still it is forcefully present in the minds of the \"Israeli\" military, political, and security leaders, \"Israeli\" public opinion, and popular \"Israeli\" disposition. This is proof that it left a deep impact on the recesses of the \"Israeli\" mind, and the \"Israelis\" deal with it as an exceptional, historic event in the history of this entity and this people who usurped Palestine and al-Quds. Thus, this anniversary has never passed without being the focus of comments, research, and scrutiny. For 11 years, this never stopped. This war was and is still the subject of their research, studies, arguments, discussions, plots, concerns, expectations, and psychological warfare. That's because for the \"Israelis\", this was a great, important, and crucial event which they are still studying. Days ago, I was following some statements. Some want to summon the Winograd Commission again because after 11 years more things were discovered which were not revealed 11 years ago. They are still studying and drawing lessons and filling up gaps. They are still exerting efforts to restore the confidence which was destroyed in the July War between the \"Israeli\" people, the \"Israeli\" Army, and the \"Israeli\" leadership. This was the most crucial repercussion of that war. They are trying to search in the minute details to find an achievement here and an achievement there even if that would be a lie - now I do not want to go into details. After 11 years, they are still acknowledging their defeat on the one hand, and the magnitude of the challenge which the resistance in Lebanon forms on the other. I want to draw your attention to this point. For the last 11 years and especially in the previous year, the \"Israelis\" have been talking about the growth of the power of Hezbollah. They talk about \"Hezbollah\" by name. They talk about the number, the troops, the vast experience, the arms, the kinds of ammunition, the missiles, the range of these missiles, the precision of these missiles...\r\n\r\nHere I am telling you on the July anniversary: with every statement and every time the \"Israelis\" talk about the growth of the power of Hezbollah, they are acknowledging their defeat in the July War 2006. Why? Because the main goal of the July War and July aggression in 2006 was to crush Hezbollah, and not (merely) weaken it. The goal was to crush Hezbollah and to defeat it once and for all. Well, for 11 years, the \"Israelis\" have been talking about the growth of the power of Hezbollah, the development of its capabilities, the number of its missiles, the precision of its missiles, and the number of its fighters. What does that mean? That means that they are acknowledging that they failed to achieve the main goal of the July War 2006, and they are facing this problem now, especially in the Herzliya Conference which took place a few months ago. The focal point is the main threat posed by Hezbollah. How are they to deal with this threat? Then comes Gaza, the resistance in Gaza, and the experience of Gaza which is the twin and comrade of the resistance in Lebanon. This is the main problem which the \"Israelis\" are suffering from and which they articulate continuously.\r\n\r\nUsually in every speech on \"Israel\", it is supposed that we say something specific. Today, I do not want to talk about the number of fighters because I tackled this point before. I do not want to talk about missiles because I talked about that before, and there are other things which I will postpone for the future. However, there is something specific I will talk about to make clear the subsequent responsibility as per Lebanon. What is the responsibility of the Lebanese people and the Lebanese politicians and everyone? When we talk about the liberation in 2000, whether by the hands of Hezbollah or the Amal Movement or the other Lebanese and Palestinian resistance front factions, the liberation of 2000 was not made via claims, slogans, calls, hopes, dreams, and expectations. It was rather the result of the serious hard work of the resistance in all domains. The same applies to the victory of 2006 which today we are marking. Were it not for the serious resistance which fights in the field and were it not also for the official political steadfastness (which I will talk about later), this victory would not be achieved. I want to tell you that following the victory of 2000 and 2006 and following all that is taking place and the events that took place in relation to the Lebanese people and \"Israel\" on the other side, there is a resistance in Lebanon - a serious resistance that does not have time to joke, to have fun, or to waste. It does not have an annual vacation. It is a resistance that works day and night. It thinks, plans, follows up, and studies all the new developments. It scrutinizes all the developments of the capacities of the enemies and the developments in the region. It reprograms and reconsiders incessantly its plans, programs, and structures. It trains and arms with the best kinds of arms it can obtain - and this is its natural right. It always makes serious, honest, and transparent updates. When it is engaged in a battle, it evaluates it, and it benefits from the experiences and lessons and accordingly takes the appropriate stances, just as what took place days ago in the Arsal and Flitah Outskirts. You have this serious resistance which has these men, capacities, and abilities. The enemy knows that this is its problem - this is the resistance whose value and importance we must know.\r\n\r\nWe are here also before a human value. This resistance is characterized by loyalty, honesty, and work aimed at achieving major and national goals. It does not search for personal benefits or partisan interests or factional profits. Days ago, I was reading (the words of) one of the politicians in Lebanon. The man is quite respectable. He has a good intellect. He said: \"We fear that after the battle in the Arsal and other outskirts comes to an end, Hezbollah will demand an amendment to the quotas in the Lebanese factional system, requiring a greater quota for the Shia\". Here I am reassuring him. We did not do that in 2000; we did not do that in 2006; now we will not do that (either); and we will not do that after we are through in Syria. I will talk about Syria in a while. The humane and moral characteristic of this resistance is that it puts national aims before its eyes, and it works to achieve these goals. It does not seek political profits as is the Lebanese way of things. Not at all! This is its primary value which must be comprehended, safeguarded, and protected. This must not be feared, it must rather be the haven to which one resorts, is assured by, and depends on. Moreover, the power of this resistance after the July War and today is becoming more and more powerful. They wanted to crush it in July 2006 but since August 14, 2006 - like tomorrow - till our day, its power is increasing. I am not exaggerating. This is what the enemy is saying, this is what is acknowledged by the antagonist, and what is known by the friend.        \r\n\r\nThe hopes of everyone who bet on crushing the resistance in the July War were lost. Today, the hopes of everyone who bet on crushing the resistance by hitting its axis in the region was lost and is lost, and all their hopes will be lost God willing, based on this development and growth in power. This is the importance of this point. \r\nNow allow me between parentheses to say that when I talk about the resistance and the enemy, I am not sending internal messages. I am not addressing the interior, and I have no business with internal antagonisms, internal considerations, and internal grudges - meaning the internal Lebanese politics. The enemy reached a conviction - not now but since 2006 - which is growing with the development of the resistance. This conviction is expressed in the specialized studies and the statements of current and former officials and leaders. Moreover, a general conviction and a general culture are now being formed among many of the \"Israelis\". This conviction is the following: Any war on Lebanon - because now they do not talk about a war on Hezbollah, they rather talk about a war on Lebanon - no matter what its targets are, it is not worth or is not equivalent to the costs which \"Israel\" would bear in such a war. The costs will be huge for the enemy - this is what the enemy is saying - and its state, people, and army. Some say the costs are unsustainable, and consequently, there are broad and wide calls in the enemy entity - even among the most extreme politicians and military men - to evade going into any war with Lebanon for whatever reason or under any condition. They say war may take place only under one condition, that of having no choice, meaning that there is no choice but war. Since when are they that much kind? They are rather saying sit calm. Things are over. The game in Lebanon is over. The story of dispatching a musical band to Lebanon or having a ride is over. The case of the invasion of 1978 and 1982 is over. \r\n\r\nWell, was this conviction born as a result of US pressure, or the international community, or the enemy's respect of international resolutions? There is nothing of this sort. This conviction was born because the \"Israelis\" know for sure - they say that they know that more than the Lebanese know, and this is quite possible - that in Lebanon there is a force which if added and integrated in the golden equation it won't remain a resistance but rather it becomes the resistance-army-people formula. We have witnessed this in the July War. In any war, the cost will be very high on \"Israel\", and it is not known whether it will achieve its goals and make victory. Well, if victory is absolute with a high cost, things would be disputable. But rather they are talking about eventual high costs and a dubious victory. This is what prevents \"Israel\" from staging an aggression against Lebanon. This is what prevents it from staging an aggression on Lebanon in the future. This is what turned our borders, towns, plains, and valleys into safe places. \r\n\r\nThis is the power which as I said we must guard and protect. The enemy takes this force into consideration. When we guard this force as Lebanon and as Lebanese, and when this power is complemented via the people-army-resistance equation, walls will be raised higher in the \"Israeli\" entity, and fears will grow more and more among the \"Israelis\", and the \"Israeli\" deterrence from staging any aggression against Lebanon will also grow. The world will respect you because - brothers and sisters and respected people - we are living in the world of wolves. We are living in a world in which the bones of the weak are crushed. We are living in a world which recognizes only the strong. So only as such will the world respect us, and only as such will the enemy respect us and take us into consideration. \r\n\r\nWe will give you a simple and new example. Some time ago we talked about the ammonia tank in Haifa. Indeed there are great economic and commercial interests from the ammonia tank. By the way, it came to be owned by someone from the Trump family - though he is not a kin of the current US president. \r\n\r\nThe \"Israelis\" were stubborn, but after all they reached a (realization) that they have to close the ammonia tank. For a year, they studied the alternatives, the choices, the Negev, and the sea. However, after all the issue was over. Thus after long and wide-ranging discussions, judicial cases, and appeal cases, I read days ago that the court ruled that the Haifa tanks must be closed finally because of the danger it poses, and it will be closed by September 13 and 14, I believe.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIf the \"Israelis\" do not respect you as a resistance, do not respect your word, and do not respect your promise and your intimidation, why do they go into a crisis of this sort? You know it is a matter of millions of dollars - which is the most valuable thing according to the \"Israelis\". That's because they respect you. Why do they respect you? That's because you are strong, and they know that you are capable. Now if they believe that you are weak, should you deliver speeches 300 days a year, should you lose your voice, that would be worthless, and that would go with the wind.\r\n\r\nAs the ammonia tank case is over, we hope God willing that they will reconsider the Dimona nuclear reactor which is more dangerous than the ammonia tank in Haifa, and this must be addressed anyway. \r\n\r\nNow because the enemy knows that a military and security war on Lebanon - a military war in particular - can't achieve its goal to crush the resistance and its cost would be enormous, it must not remain silent on the growth of the power which they talk about daily, thus they resort to other means. What are these other means?\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis issue requires the resistance of the Lebanese. Here I will talk about a collective responsibility. The factor on which the \"Israelis\" bet today is the Trump administration and the pressure this administration would practice to achieve this goal. \r\n\r\nThe Obama administration used to work against us, and it never failed in doing so. Still, they bet that the Trump administration would be tougher and harsher, that the US administration would practice more pressure on Hezbollah, practice pressure on the Lebanese government, practice pressure on the Lebanese people, practice pressure on the friends of Hezbollah and the supporters of Hezbollah, and the masses of Hezbollah, whether in Lebanon or in other states in the region. \r\n\r\nAny person, bank, media outlet, newspaper, political, deputy, or minister who talks kindly about Hezbollah will be confronted with pressure and threats. This is the means available now. \r\n\r\nThey resorted to the US financial sanctions. Efforts are being exerted to confront this issue but it is required (that we all) not submit to it. Here I will jump directly to the conclusion: neither financial sanctions, nor US threats and intimidation, nor all the means available and possible to the US administration can do harm to the force of the resistance, the will of the resistance, and the determination of the resistance, and the growth of the power of resistance in Lebanon.  \r\n\r\nThey are troubling themselves. That does not mean that they stop trying. The financial sanctions are still ongoing. They tighten Hezbollah financially. Should anyone grant and donate money, they will impose sanctions on him, and they started some procedures to this effect. \r\n\r\nWhat is more dangerous and crucial is the psychological pressure and intimidation practiced on states, governments, parties, and personalities, not only in Lebanon but also in the entire region: who contacts Hezbollah? This is a terrorist party? Whoever contacts Hezbollah will be punished and boycotted. This is a supporter of terrorism. So they want to silence everyone.\r\n\r\nThere is something which I postponed talking about the other time. That's when the US president Trump talked about Hezbollah in the presence of the Lebanese Premier as well as the statements made by US officials or secretaries or the UN ambassador. Have you noticed that the successive US ambassadors are all women, and they all overbid Netanyahu? What is the rhetoric they are using? \r\n\r\nFirst, let's comment briefly on Trump's acquaintance and knowledge with the political situation in the region. In fact, the Lebanese media outlets did not make a precise quote. Later the quote was translated with precision. That's when he said that the US and Lebanon are partners in the war on terrorism represented by Daesh and Hezbollah. Imagine that there is a person who does not know that Hezbollah is a partner in the Lebanese government, and (someone who believes) that the US and the Lebanese government are partners in the war on terrorism represented by Daesh and Hezbollah, and he does not know that Hezbollah is in the Lebanese government and part of this government, and he doesn't know that some of its friends in Lebanon claim that Hezbollah controls the Lebanese government - which is merely an invalid fabrication. We never controlled the Lebanese government - neither this government nor the former one nor all the previous ones. He does not know this, and he wishes to lead the battle in the region. Furthermore, I want you to listen to me very well. Second, he does not know that the Lebanese government up until that time had not been engaged yet in a war against Daesh. Well, the security apparatuses are exerting efforts, and the intelligence directorate and the security apparatuses are doing a respectable job. However, the military battle with Daesh up until that time had not started yet. Now the Lebanese government will start in its battle against Daesh in the remaining outskirts in Beqaa. I will tackle this point later. \r\n\r\nLet's put his knowledge or ignorance aside and move to the expressions with which he described Hezbollah. Allow me to talk extensively about Hezbollah because we are on top of the black list. He referred to Hezbollah as a destructive power. So first comes terrorism. Next, it is a destructive power. Third he referred to it as a dangerous power, by saying that Hezbollah poses a danger on Lebanon and the region. \r\n\r\nI want to add one quick comment. You already know what I'm going to say, but I'll just talk about it to show that we've responded.\r\n\r\nFirst as per terrorism, the terrorists are America, \"Israel\", and the groups formed by America and \"Israel\". I've repeated this a hundred times. For one year and throughout his electoral campaign, Trump kept saying that Obama and Hillary Clinton created Daesh. You have created Daesh, and Hezbollah was one of those fighting the terrorists in the region.\r\n\r\nHezbollah is not terrorist. Hezbollah is a force that fights terrorists alongside all those who are fighting it. \r\n\r\nHe said that Hezbollah is a destructive force, a dangerous force. Yes someone could stop at these words and say that the Sayyed admitted that Hezbollah is a destructive, dangerous force. You can take this extract (only), there is no problem. But the continuation of this would be that Hezbollah is a destructive, dangerous force for the \"Israeli\" project (in the region). It was and will always be.\r\n\r\nHezbollah as a basic part of the resistance destroyed, shattered, and smashed the great \"Israeli\" project in 2000. The downfall of the Great \"Israel\" is being proved every day and every time a big wall is raised in Lebanon on the frontiers with Palestine, and every time a wall is raised in the West Bank and Gaza. \r\n\r\nThe Great \"Israel\" has been destroyed, and Hezbollah was a part of the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance in the region which destroyed it. Indeed Hezbollah was part of the regional resistance that destroyed the haughty arrogant Great \"Israel\" in 2006, as did Gaza in its successive wars, the last of which was in 2014. \r\nHezbollah destroyed the \"Israeli\" project in the region, or some parts, alternatives, or options within this scheme.\r\n\r\nIn the July War during which it was the spearhead, Hezbollah was the one that destroyed the \"New Middle East\" - the project of Condoleezza Rice in the region. \r\nThat's right, Hezbollah is destructive and dangerous, but (only) for your schemes, occupations, and hegemony. Now what about you - America and \"Israel\"? \"Israel\" is an entity that occupies and usurps land and commits massacres. It commits terrorism daily in the al-Aqsa Mosque, in al-Quds, in the West Bank, in territories occupied since 1948, in Gaza, and everywhere. You perpetrated all the aggressions, destruction, and demolition, and all the wars waged upon the states, governments, and peoples of the region. You financed and commanded them as well as the wars in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. These are all (the result of) the US and \"Israeli\" will, administrations, and commands. \r\n\r\nSo don't describe others with traits that better describe you.\r\n\r\nHezbollah along with the other resistance groups is a force of goodwill, defense, and protection. It is a force that maintains existence and destroys danger. Therefore, these traits and accusations won't affect our will.\r\n\r\nSo where is this leading to? Whether knowingly or not, when Trump and the Americans talk this way, they actually want to practice pressure on the Lebanese people. Today, we are facing an act of intimidation. I hope that no Lebanese are covert partners in this act of intimidation. This is manifested when someone shows up and says that Lebanon will be facing international sanctions from America, Europe, the Arab world and the Gulf. Woe unto you, O' Lebanon! So, I hope none of the Lebanese are covertly instigating or are a partner in this intimidation. This is intimidation practiced against the Lebanese. We have lived (being subjected to) intimidation since the day we were born. During past decades, we've witnessed a lot of intimidation. The officials in the government are more affected by this intimidation, and I'm talking based on information and facts. This intimidation is found in closed rooms, in diplomatic meetings, and in international visits. There is intimidation, pressure, and threats. Look and make some comparisons, and I urge the Lebanese officials to make this comparison. The \"Israelis\" are saying that they don't want to make war with Lebanon, they don't want to go to war. The costs are high, they are higher than any goal that could be achieved via this war. They say that they only launch war when they have no other choice. But in closed meetings, the Americans and Europeans tell the Lebanese officials that if they don't do so and so, then \"Israel\" will wage a war on Lebanon, or that if Hezbollah doesn't do such and such, then \"Israel\" will declare war on Lebanon. How is that possible?\r\n\r\nI say that we should be strong. Once we're psychologically strong, we'll be practically and eventually strong, and we will be strong in the field. Strength starts from within. Everyone should know that strength is born inside, and it is not the weapons, tanks, missiles, planes, or the number of your army that matters. What matters is who you are. What does your will, state of mind, soul, intellect, determination, preparation, courage, firmness, dignity, honor, and saving your face mean to you? When we're strong from within, we should not be scared of anything. Aren't we in the era of victory? The era in which the \"Israeli\" threatens and implements his threats has long gone. The tables are turned. \r\n\r\nI will make a nice digression here. I'm not saying hypotheses, I'm just stating what happened. If an environmental or agricultural association, or a municipality in the South planted a green tree on the frontiers, \"Israel\" would file a complaint to the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council against Lebanon. What is the complaint, they would ask. They're planting trees on the frontiers. What is the problem? They would say that the UNIFIL went and saw the tree, any they didn't find any explosive device or camera or weapon. Unless they tie the green color of the tree to the military uniform, then they are right, that could be a violation, for example. \r\n\r\nWhy is it so? Today, the \"Israelis\" are afraid of our trees on the frontiers because they think that trees protect our country, our villages, our people, and those who will face their aggression should they choose to attack. Thus they want to have trees while they wish for us to be in a desert. This applies not only to nature but rather to everything.  They want to have knowledge and to leave us in ignorance. They want to own a nuclear weapon while we are not to be allowed to own a missile or a machine gun. They want to have technology while we go back and ride on donkeys and camels. They want to stay above trees and greeneries while we stay below in a barren land. Should we accept that? After all that we've been through, we, the Lebanese people, should not accept that. \r\n\r\nAlright, today they object to the tree. Now should a young Lebanese man not wearing military attire go up and walk along the frontiers and look in the direction of Lebanon, that would not be considered a violation of Resolution 1701. But should he stand at the barbed-wire fence and look in the direction of Palestine, he would be violating Resolution 1701. They would talk to the Security Council to charge the UNIFIL to inspect this problem which needs to be resolved. No young Lebanese man should look in the direction of Palestine when walking on the barbed-wire fence. Why? Because he would be exploring and gathering information. On the other hand, the \"Israelis\" have the right to install cameras, radars and piloted aircrafts every day and every hour in Lebanon's sky, and it would not be a violation. But when a young, civil, Lebanese man, whether he belongs to the resistance or not, stands on the frontiers and looks in the direction of Palestine, that would be considered a violation of Resolution 1701. Who do they complain to? They would complain to the Security Council, and they already did. We've complained to the Security Council for 60 years but it was in vain. So go and complain. We are going to keep planting green trees on the frontiers. The municipalities will, and so will the associations and the people. Not just the municipalities and the associations should plant trees, I also urge the people of South, of western Bekaa, of Baalbek-Hermel, and of the eastern and the western mountain ranges to plant trees wherever there are mountains and frontiers. This is a part of the resistance. This is a part of protecting Lebanon. So plant trees and don't wait for the government, the ministry, the associations, and the institutions to do it. Each person should plant trees around and in front of his house and in his garden. This protects our country on the security and military level. So besides being good to keep the environment green, trees have other benefits.  \r\n\r\nToday, the \"Israelis\" have the right to do whatever they want with the settlements. They can build high passages and install radars on them. However, if a front-lying village builds a water tank which is a bit high, the UNIFIL climbs up the tank to make sure no cameras are installed or to see if they are spying on \"Israel\". They tell the \"Israelis\" that there are no cameras, yet still the \"Israelis\" would keep thinking what would become of this tank in the case of war. \r\n\r\nThis is excellent. This feeling reflects weakness. When the \"Israelis\", who never took Lebanon seriously and always underestimated Lebanon and its people and everything inside it, reach a state in which they fear the tree on the frontiers and in villages and fear the water tank and the young man walking on the barbed-wire (fence) looking at Palestine, it means that they hit rock bottom, even if they have a tremendous armed force. That's because their psyche is in a state of weakness and feebleness. When our people have the courage to build their homes near the barbed-wire, plant trees, and walk in the middle of the night along it, and when they work in their fields and plains, that means that we've reached the peak of our psychological power, apart from our military force.\r\n\r\nThis is what they want us to compromise today. This is why I urge everyone to confront and resist them. They can't do anything about it. If anything, they will practice pressure. But there are lots of obstacles that will not allow them to be successful in this file and in this regard.\r\n\r\nWell, now we reach the second last section. From July 2006 to July 2017, we witness a new victory in another battle, which is nevertheless linked to the very first battle. It is the victory which was achieved weeks ago in the Arsal and Flitah Outskirts. We witness the same norms and standards and considerations. Why am I saying the same battle? Look at the \"Israelis\". They are the most saddened side by what took place in the Arsal and Flitah Outskirts. The \"Israelis\" are the saddest side. As for those in Lebanon, I had said let's not say who was saddened and who was not. I am talking about the \"Israelis\"; the \"Israelis\" got sad - very sad. What took place in Syria made the \"Israelis\" very sad. \"Israel\" is weeping over the terrorist and Takfiri groups upon which \"Israel\" bet in Syria and which have started to lose now. \"Israel\", along with the US, is expressing its frustration, especially in relation to Daesh. The \"Israelis\" are exerting efforts and are still exerting efforts along with the US administration to the effect of preventing the defeat of Daesh in Syria. That's because the defeat of Daesh in Syria means the victory of Iran, President Bashar al-Assad, and Hezbollah in particular. The \"Israelis\" are keen that Daesh, al-Nusra, and the armed groups gain victory in Syria. In fact, the \"Israelis\" have ties with these armed groups which they support, finance, and arm. They also submit their wounded into their hospitals and provide their militants with information. Furthermore, if the armed groups feel uncomfortable in southern Syria, the \"Israelis\" interfere and back them with artillery shelling and airstrikes. Thus this battle is an extension of that very battle. \r\n\r\nWell, I have three quick points under this topic. \r\n\r\nFirst, it is assumed that tomorrow or the day after - within a few days at most - the remaining militants should quit the Arsal Outskirts and head into Syria - based on the facilitations thankfully offered by the Syrian leadership as usual. The Lebanese Army took the decision to deploy in that area - and this is a popular request. Consequently, what remains of this area in the Arsal Outskirts and along the confrontation line with Daesh from the side of Arsal will be in the hands of the Army. Once the Army goes up and sets up bases, we will withdraw and give them the area. Hereof, I am informing the residents of Arsal that henceforth, they can go and contact the Army - indeed in what falls in line with its new condition. Still, these are your rights, orchids, trees, and quarries. Trust in Allah. The days that separate you from that are but few. \r\n\r\nThe second point has to do with what we are up to. Indeed not only we in Lebanon but also Syria is awaiting the decision to be taken by the Lebanese Army command which is the side which will decide the time of the new battle to liberate the rest of the Lebanese outskirts and on the other side, liberating the Syrian outskirts from Daesh. \r\n\r\nThe decision is final. There were attempts to frustrate the Lebanese from moving along in this decision, but Lebanese President Michel Aoun's call for the Higher Defense Council to meet and the consultations that took place there finally settled on this choice. We can say with pride that today we have a true national, political, sovereign decision, which is not submissive to any external considerations, to liberate a part of the Lebanese land which is occupied by Daesh - this Daesh which the whole world, the friend and the foe, unanimously agree is a terrorist organization. Consequently, the decision is final. This stage is over. The timing is in the hand of the Army. Everyone is waiting, and things will move in the right path God willing. \r\n\r\nHere I have a request because people started tackling this point. I hope that no one will make a mistake and put a timetable for the Army on this front and on that front. Let no one say it is required that the Army settle the battle in two days or seven days. Why? I also hope that no one will make comparisons between this battle and that battle. Put grudges and machinations aside. We are now heading towards a national battle in which blood is to be shed - the blood of the young men in the Lebanese Army and the resistance and the Syrian Army....It is not time for overbids. At least no one in our political and media side must try to score and make records. You know that our coalition is wide. We don't want anyone from the March 8 bloc to say that the Army is late in putting an end to the battle, the resistance ended the battle in a couple of days. This is nonsense. Let no one put a time table for this battle. Let them fight at ease. Let no one compare between battles. Every battle has its own conditions and facts and difficulties. However, I like at the end of this point to say that God willing we will be before a final victory. The victory will be achieved God willing. As for Daesh, they will be defeated and they will flee. This is for sure. That is if no other solutions were sought. So it is only a matter of time and a matter of dealing with a national and humanitarian spirit with the upcoming battle which is to the interest of everyone. \r\n\r\nThe third point in the second last section has to do with the discussions taking place in Lebanon. We have witnessed arguments pertaining to coordination between the Lebanese and Syrian armies unfortunately this week and in the past ten days at most: shall the ministers go to Syria or not? Shall we coordinate with the Syrian government or not? There are well known political forces in Lebanon which have sharp stances as per this issue, though it is not we who evoked this argument in the government to cause a crisis - others evoked this topic to make a crisis. We do not want to make a crisis. Ministers used to go to Syria always. This is not the first time, this is not something new. However, I want to talk about more than coordination between the two armies in the upcoming battle and more than whether this minister will go to Syria or not. I want to address these political forces which have a sharp stance in a calm, responsible way: listen to me and reconsider things. The scheme you bet on in Syria collapsed, and it is about to come to an end. It is clear that the scheme you bet on and are still betting on in Syria collapsed or is in the last stages of collapsing. Wherever you are now in Lebanon - whether in the city or the village or the mountain or the valley as it is summer now - make your contemplations and reread the developments that took place in Syria and the region. See the facts and take stances accordingly. \r\n\r\nFirst: put the grudge, dreams, hopes, desires, and expectations aside. Take the facts, analyze them, and take the decision accordingly. Facts say that Daesh is a matter of time in Syria. It is a matter of time in Iraq. The decision to eliminate Daesh is final. Daesh will not find anyone to defend it in the world after all the atrocities, crimes, and massacres it perpetrated against Islam, divine religions, and all people. \r\n\r\nSecond: the armed opposition is in its worst conditions, and in most places it is besieged. \r\n\r\nThird: the political opposition is weak from the very beginning, and now it is becoming feebler following the political crisis between the Gulf and Qatar. \r\n\r\nFourth: the new administration in France, which was most fanatic and extreme about Syria, now recognizes President Bashar al-Assad as the legitimate president of Syria. \r\n\r\nFifth: one after the other, the Gulf States started pulling their hands (out of Syria). Now wait for more. Later, this will blame that, and that will blame this. This is what we will see in the future. I am talking facts and not predictions.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Americans announced that the groups they funded, trained, and bet on failed, are hopeless, and may be dangerous, thus they stopped supporting some of these groups. \r\n\r\nAmerica today is negotiating with Russia over its interests and the interests of \"Israel\" in Syria. This is America. They know that the game is over as per America. \r\nThe entire world is now acting on the basis that this regime will remain, that this army will remain, that this state in Syria and its institutions will remain. Some time ago, they used to believe that these are over. They were still arguing on the president. But now, everyone is acting and telling the opposition in closed sessions: act as if President Bashar al-Assad will remain in office. A political settlement will be reached in Syria. How will the \"moderate opposition\" - if it exists - find a way to be in power and be a partner in the political authority? This is the information and facts of the closed sessions - most of which are now reported by media outlets. \r\n\r\nTo return to the concerned officials in Lebanon, I tell them reconsider this issue very well. I do not want anyone to rejoice at the misfortune of others. I do not want anyone to open up accounts with anyone else. Let's see what the interests of Lebanon in all of this equation are. We are talking about the interests of Lebanon. Let's put the interests of Syria aside. We are with them to achieve the interests of Syria. \r\n\r\nIn fact, these opposing and reserved political forces can't help Syria whatsoever. Neither your recognition makes any difference, nor does your normalization make any difference. Now, there is no need for such negative rhetoric. Let's talk about the interests of Lebanon.\r\n\r\nGeographically speaking, besides the sea, Lebanon has common borders with Palestine which is occupied by \"Israel\", and Syria. By reason of geography and history, the interests of Lebanon with Syria are by far more than the interests of Syria with Lebanon. This is nothing new in Lebanon. Even now, in all or most of the files, we - Lebanon - need to contact Syria. Lebanon needs that. \r\n\r\nI can give many examples. For example, when the border is liberated, the army wants to go and deploy there. How is it to deploy on both sides? Are we to talk with the Americans? How shameful! They agree to sit with the \"Israelis\" in Naqoura. They agree to sit with the \"Israeli\" enemy who slaughtered us, killed us, destroyed our country, and waged wars on us, and we say that in Lebanon there is a consensus that \"Israel\" is an enemy - still, they argue whether officers from the Lebanese and Syrian armies can sit to coordinate with each other. It is in the interests of Lebanon that they talk with each other. It is in interests of Lebanon and not the interests of Hezbollah or this party or that movement, or this faction or that sect. Not at all! It is a national interest that they sit and talk with each other. \r\n\r\nIt is in our natural interest that the border between Lebanon and Syria be open. It is our national interest that Lebanon agrees with Syria over agriculture and our products and their products. Our national interest imposes on us to agree with Syria because soon the borders with Iraq will open as well as the borders with Jordan. Then you will want to export Lebanese products.\r\n\r\nIn the past when they closed the borders with Syria, a senior official in Lebanon told me personally that he does not want to talk with the Syrians, he rather wants to transport Lebanese agricultural products via airplanes. What a witty economic mind! Imagine that the Middle East airplanes are transporting potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, and bananas to be sold abroad, because if we do not transport them on board of airplanes we will not find a market for them. But you know already that the cost of labor in Lebanon is expensive. \r\n\r\nWe in Lebanon - all the Lebanese, whether working in agriculture, industry, or trade - need to have ties with Syria. As per the security situation, we need to talk with Syria. As for the oil and gas blocks in the north, you need to delineate the borders to be able to bring companies. You have to talk with Syria. You are ready to talk with \"Israel\", but you don't want to talk with Syria.    \r\n\r\nSo let's put such personal considerations aside, our partisan considerations aside, our grudges aside, and discuss our national interest. This is Syria: its regime, state, and president will remain in office, and it is heading towards a political settlement.\r\n\r\nThe only neighbor for us is Syria because on the other side we have the enemy. What is the interest of Lebanon as per gas, oil, electrical power, agriculture, industry, security, and the borders? Is it in talking with the Syrians or in building barricades and sleeping and dreaming of the projects which fell and collapsed?\r\n\r\nToday, as far as this issue is concerned, we can benefit from the July War. Excuse me, I took much of your time. I still have a few minutes. I thank you for tolerating me, and I apologies for talking for more than an hour. In the July War, there was the resistance. We had the Army too and a popular supporting environment in most of the regions, if we are not to say in all of the regions and among most of the political movements. There was an official solidarity but there was a political gap in the July War. \r\n\r\nAs for political solidarity, His Excellence President Emile Lahoud was heading the cabinet and leading a battle along with the rest of the ministers. In the political, negotiating, media, popular, and military battle, we had a full partner named Speaker Nabih Berri. \r\n\r\nFrankly speaking, we had a gap which is the Premiership and the formation of the government. You know that, I am not attacking anyone. The battle was in the government. \r\n\r\nDespite this official and popular gap, we could gain victory over an enemy of this magnitude. Well, perhaps this word is a bit heavy for them. Let's say we could frustrate the goals of the aggression.     \r\n\r\nToday, we have a new experience under the new President, the old-new Premier, and the Speaker - may Allah prolong his life span and the life spans of everyone God willing. We have a national conviction, and we will make use of this atmosphere prevailing now in the Arsal Outskirts. We do not want to invest the atmosphere now prevailing in the Arsal Outskirts for partisan benefits. Let's invest this atmosphere for national interests and for talking about national interests. Why should anyone be afraid? No one must be afraid should we have ties with Syria. Let's talk with Syria, negotiate with Syria, and coordinate with Syria. This is in the interest of Lebanon. We can all talk with each other and cooperate to achieve it.\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the victory of rightfulness over injustice in July 2006 and the victory of blood over the sword, allow me to tackle a point outside of the battle with \"Israel\", though in fact it is within it. Allow me to mention the worst humanitarian catastrophe, which is taking place in Yemen.  \r\n\r\nThe United Nations is saying that currently the worst humanitarian catastrophe is that which is taking place in Yemen. Thousands are dying from cholera. Hundreds of thousands are infected with cholera. Millions are threatened of dying by hunger. What is the reason? That does not need much wit...the reason is war and the siege. Who is waging the war and imposing the siege? They are America, Saudi Arabia, and their allies. \r\n\r\nTo stop this humanitarian catastrophe, the whole world must call on America and Saudi Arabia to stop the aggression and war on Yemen lift the siege imposed on it. In my own viewpoint, all those who are silent in the world are held responsible. Should America and Saudi Arabia hear all world governments, states, parliaments, parties, scholars, movements, forces, and media outlets calling on them to stop practicing this terrible, loathsome aggression on this people, they would have at least thought of stopping the war. \r\n\r\nA global, Arab, and Islamic call is required. Otherwise what would a condemnation from here and a description from there do while the catastrophe is continuing, mushrooming, and worsening every day in Yemen?  \r\n\r\nOn this day, we are supposed to say this rightful word though it may disturb some people. Apart from all considerations, this is a humanitarian stance and a moral stance. Stop this war. Lift the siege. Treat the Yemenis for cholera. Stop the outbreak of Cholera. Stop the famine. Look for a political solution. The political solution is always possible and available, however, there are always sides which want to humiliate others and impose their conditions on others.  \r\n\r\nO' brothers and sisters! As we will soon be marking the sad anniversary of our absented Imam Sayyed Mousa al-Sadr and both his comrades on August 31, we salute this Imam who launched the resistance movement and revived in us the spirit of resistance and the culture of resistance. He consecrated in our culture the cause of al-Quds and the al-Aqsa Mosque. He is the Imam of coexistence and transcending sensitivities and personal, factional, sectarian, and partisan considerations. He is the Imam of honesty, faithfulness, and loyalty to the homeland, sanctities, and the nation. We greet, highly esteem, and express our gratitude to the teacher, the inspirer, and the master and tell him we are all your sons and daughters and your men and women. We will move along on your path and realize all your dreams God willing, and the victory of July 2006 is no more than one of the fruits of the seeds you planted.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings, and may you be blessed every year.\r\n\r\n"},

Since July 26, they said, Saudi authorities prevented emergency services from reaching the wounded and failed to provide humanitarian assistance to trapped Awamia citizens.\r\n\r\nThe residents also noted that an order had never been issued for people to leave Awamia while their only chance out of the town had been short periods coordinated with local volunteers and activists.\r\n\r\nAwamia, situated in Eastern Province, has long been a flashpoint between the Al Saud family and the inhabitants complaining of discrimination.\r\n\r\nStephane Dujarric, the spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, recently said that the world body could not independently verify the reports coming out of Awamia, but all Riyadh's actions should be in line with its commitments to human rights.\r\n\r\nThis is while multiple human rights groups have voiced concerns over the situation in Awamia, and criticized Western countries for keeping mum on Saudi Arabia's atrocities there.\r\n\r\nLast month, Ottawa expressed \"deep concerns\" over the Saudis' use of Canadian military equipment in their growing crackdown against the minority Shia citizens in the restive Eastern Province.\r\n\r\nProminent human rights groups have on numerous occasions called on Saudi Arabia's major arms suppliers, including the US and the UK, to stop selling Riyadh military equipment.\r\n"},

He said that imbalances in China-US trade are mainly the result of global industrial trends, as well as disparities in the two countries' economic structures and development.\r\n\r\nHe also called on Washington to help alleviate bilateral trade imbalances by easing restrictions on technology exports to civilian users in China, and improving the investment climate for Chinese businesses in the US.\r\n\r\nZheng's remarks came a day after China's Foreign Ministry confirmed that Xi and Trump would hold their first meeting on April 6-7 at the US president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.\r\n\r\nAfter the Chinese announcement, Trump suggested that he would press Xi hard on trade-a centerpiece issue of his presidential campaign.\r\n\r\n\"The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one,\" Trump tweeted late Thursday. \"We can no longer have massive trade deficits ... and job losses. American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.\"\r\n\r\nChina has pushed for a two-way summit for several weeks, hoping that it would set bilateral relations on a more stable footing, diplomats say. On the campaign trail and as president, Trump has sharply criticized China on trade and security issues, including allegations that Beijing hasn't done enough to curb North Korea's nuclear program.\r\n\r\nThe Trump administration has been contemplating measures to counter what it describes as unfair Chinese trade practices. US officials are preparing a review of China's \"market-economy status\" under the World Trade Organization, in a process that could keep Chinese goods eligible for higher US tariffs well into the future. \r\n\r\nBeijing has been particularly concerned about the prospects of a trade war, based on the Trump team's pledges to eliminate the $500 billion US trade deficit-the bulk of it with China-and to label Beijing a currency manipulator, an allegation that Chinese officials deny.\r\n\r\nChina has \"no intention of stimulating exports through competitive currency devaluation,\" Zheng said at Friday's briefing. \"That's not our policy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"},

At the same time we need the ability to safeguard our sovereignty and interests and rights,\" said spokeswoman for China's National People's Congress Fu Ying.\r\n\r\n\"In particular,\" she added, \"We need to guard against outside meddling in the disputes,\" without elaborating on the source of meddling.\r\n\r\nChina is engaged in a dispute with the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam in the South China Sea, where they have overlapping claims of sovereignty over a series of islands and reefs. Beijing is also entangled in a similar territorial row with Japan elsewhere in the East China Sea.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the United States has been fueling tensions between China and its neighbors by siding with Beijing's rivals.\r\n\r\nBeijing has on numerous occasions slammed Washington for intervening in regional issues and deliberately escalating the situation in the disputed waters.\r\n\r\nFu further said its military buildup was purely for defense objectives and represented a force for stability in Asia.\r\n\r\nThe planned rise in the Chinese defense budget came just days after US President Donald Trump outlined plans to beef up American military forces by raising expenditures by around 10 percent.\r\n\r\nIn February, Trump reassured visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in February that his administration remains committed to maintaining long-standing US \"security\" alliance with Japan, especially when it comes to the disputed islands in the East China Sea, known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese.\r\n\r\nTrump's pledge of support for Japan angered Beijing, with its Foreign Ministry emphasizing China's maritime rights and sovereignty over the islands in the disputed waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},

Their participation in the war, which has left nearly 400,000 people dead, comes at a time when the Chinese government is one of al-Assad's strongest international backers.\r\n\r\nAlong with Russia, China used its veto power at the UN Security Council on several occasions to prevent the imposition of international sanctions against its Arab ally.\r\nBeijing blamed violence back at home and against Chinese targets around the world on extremist militants with foreign connections seeking an independent state in Xinjiang. \r\n\r\nThe government said some of them are fleeing the country to join the fight, although critics say the Uighurs are discriminated against and economically marginalized in their homeland and are merely seeking to escape repressive rule by the majority Han Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},
