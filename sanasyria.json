the stances of certain\u00a0governments and parties which deliberately distort facts and deny the main reasons for the\u00a0situation in Syria.He said that Syria has sent two identical letters\u00a0to the UN Secretary General and the President of the UN Security Council which include\nits detailed response to this report, wondering about the intention of the authors of\u00a0the report which is supposed to focus on means of tackling the humanitarian situation, but\u00a0instead they insist to force issues into it which have no relation to the humanitarian\u00a0issue in a way that contradicts the facts of the ground.Munzer pointed out that some governments of the\u00a0Council\u2019s member states continue to impose coercive unilateral economic measures on the\u00a0Syrian people that deprive them from the basic requirements of their life, affirming that\u00a0all the Syrians are besieged and exhausted by the coercive unilateral economic\u00a0measures adopted by these states which shed crocodile tears on the Syrian people, particularly\nthe US and EU countries.He noted that the areas which the UN erroneously\u00a0classified as besieged are actually controlled by armed terrorist groups which impose\u00a0a siege on their residents and use them as human shields, and they also prevent\u00a0humanitarian aid from entering to those areas.The charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires said the report\u2019s use of the\u00a0term forced displacement to characterize the reconciliations which have been\naccomplished in many areas across the country is a dangerous trend as it reflects the\u00a0stances of governments that seek to provide cover and protection for the terrorist\u00a0groups in Syria.He also expressed the Syrian government\u2019s\u00a0condemnation of the authors\u2019 biased endorsement of the American narrative about the alleged use of\u00a0chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun, affirming that Syrian never used such substances\u00a0and reiterating that the Khan Sheikhoun incident was fabricated by terrorist\u00a0organizations, mainly Jabhat al-Nusra supported by\u00a0the government of some countries for the purpose\u00a0of accusing the Syrian government.Munzer went on to say that the authors of the\u00a0report are determined to ignore the catastrophic effects of the illegal airstrikes\ncarried out by the US-led international coalition which led to the killing of scores of\u00a0innocent civilians in the north and east of Syria, adding that they also attempted to\u00a0justify the Turkish regime\u2019s military aggression against Syrian sovereignty as well\u00a0Turkey\u2019s support for terrorist groups in Syria.The Syrian government provides about 75% of the\u00a0volume of humanitarian needs and deals positively with the UN and Japanese proposals for\u00a0facilitating the movement of monthly convoys, he elaborated, adding that the Syrian\u00a0government confirms the need for the UN to commit to coordinating with it on the basis of\npartnership and cooperation regarding various aspects of humanitarian work, and not to\u00a0deal with or yield to the political agendas adopted by the government of some member\u00a0states.Munzer stressed that the Syrian government\u00a0dismisses the allegations and accusations directed by the authors of the report regarding\u00a0procedural and logistic issues connected with delivery the humanitarian aid to unstable\u00a0areas, adding that the Syrian government has provided facilitations for the delivery of\nmore than 15 humanitarian convoys as per the monthly periodical convoy plan for April and\u00a0May, and work continues to send more convoys.He said that the OCHA and the authors of the\u00a0reports deliberately ignore the convoys which were run jointly by the International Committee of\u00a0the Red Cross and Syrian Arab Red Crescent, criticizing the OCHA office in Syria for\u00a0its lax efforts in organizing convoys and its selective tendencies in terms of which\u00a0areas receive convoys.The charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires asserted that the Syrian\u00a0people are still being victimized by what the hypocrisy and lies going on inside the Council\nthat are practiced by the same group of countries which don\u2019t want to put an end to the\u00a0crisis in Syria, but instead want to continue to manage and exploit terrorism and\u00a0impose an economic siege of the Syrian people.Munzer concluded by reiterating that the Syrian\u00a0government will continue its constructive role to ensure the success of the Astana and\nGeneva meetings.For his Part, Russia\u2019s representative at the UN\u00a0criticized the report submitted to the UN Security Council on Syria, saying that it\u2019s not\nbased on any clear methodology, while the Chinese representative hoped that the efforts\u00a0exerted in Astana and Geneva will lead to improving the humanitarian situation in Syria and\u00a0enhance the political process.H.

It did not use chemical and biological weapons against Vietnam. It did not use Uranium against Iraq. It did not try atomic bomb on living Algerian civilians in the Sahara desert.\u201cDuring Geneva talk on March 31st, I have informed the UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, about early and documented reports on armed terrorist groups\u2019 possession of toxic chemical materials in Damascus Countryside, Idleb and Hama in order to use them against civilians,\u201d said al-Jaafari adding that \u201cI have also warned him of falsifying facts and fabricating evidence and accusing the Syrian government just like what happened previously. I have told de Mistura about this five days before the incident of Khan Sheikhoun.\u201dHe confirmed that the Syrian government has sent 90 letters to the UNSC on the terrorist organizations, topped by Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS, possession of toxic chemical materials including sarin gas, that have been smuggled from Libya through Turkey to Syria.Syria\u2019s Representative called upon the UNSC member states to resort to logic and consideration in order to get clear answers to the questions raised after this painful incident and the reactions of the US, France and Britain.He asked for answers to the questions: Why the videos and photos of Khan Sheikhoun incident have not been released but by organizations that operate in the humanitarian field?, adding that \u201cHere, I am talking about White Helmets group whose members work under the supervision of British intelligence and receive funds from the US and Britain. This is the first question.\u201d\u201cSecondly, have you read the statement of Swedish Doctors for Human Rights organization which revealed the deception of the so-called \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d?. Thirdly, Do you know that the British doctor Shajul Islam who was with the armed terrorist groups in Khan Sheikhoun and the main eyewitness in all provocative media campaigns against the Syrian government is of Pakistani origin and has been arrested 13 months ago in Britain on charges related to terrorism, including the abduction of two British journalists in Syria?Al-Jaafari called upon the member states to read about the mediating role of US Ambassador in Libya in exporting weapons and Sarin gas from Libya to other states which supported terrorists in Syria, especially Turkey in the author Aaron Klein\u2019 book entitled \u201cThe Real Benghazi Story. What the White House and Hillary Don\u2019t Want You to Know\u201d.He also invited them to read a scientific report by Professor Tudor from Massachusetts Institute of Technology evaluating the White House\u2019s allegations on what happened in Khan Sheikhoun where the American Professor says that the US officials relied on a hole in the road north to Khan Sheikhoun to point fingers of accusation to the Syrian state.Al-Jaafari wondered what would the French representative say about the French war planes which killed 200 civilians in Toukhan al-Kubra village in the countryside of Aleppo on July 19th, 2016 and what would the US representative say about the US planes killing 237 civilians in al-Mansoura town who fled away from ISIS in al-Raqqa city?He stressed Syria\u2019s commitment to carry out its obligations after joining the OPCW convention and to continue its war on terrorism, extending, on behalf of the Syrian government, appreciation and gratitude to the friendly states of Russia and Bolivia which voted against the draft law as well as other delegation which abstained from voting.Earlier, \u00a0al-Jaafari said that the US administration is pushing the terrorist war on Syria towards dangerous levels through moving from a stage of proxy aggression into that on its own behalf through direct military action.Al-Jaafari made his remarks during a UN Security Council session held today to discuss the\u00a0draft resolution submitted by the US, Britain and France on the use of Chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun in Idleb province.He said that the US administration has felt that the terrorist groups had begun to retreat, so it committed its aggression on al-Shairat air base.Al-Jaafari said it seems that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU pushes it to seek to a new role through an extremist discourse which reminds us of the criminal role of former British prime minister Tony Blair\u00a0who led Britain into the invasion and occupation of Iraq 14 years ago after fabricating the lie about Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction, a war to which the Iraqi people continue to pay the cost till this day.\u201cAbout a week ago, we thought that we are going to attend this session and share with you the outcomes of what has been achieved in the recent meetings in Astana and Geneva and confirm our support to the efforts exerted by the UN special envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura and those who are serious about reaching a political settlement to the crisis in Syria and coordinating counterterrorism efforts,\u201d the Syrian diplomat added.He noted that the US has never refrained from providing all kinds of support to the terrorist groups in order to perpetrate the most heinous crimes against civilians and the infrastructure in Syria and this includes the practices of the so-called international coalition to fight the ISIS which provided an aerial cover to the ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and other terrorist groups, not to mention its bombardment of infrastructure and civilians, adding that the best example for that is targeting a Syrian military site in al-Tharda Mountain in Deir Ezzor on September 17, 2016.Al-Jaafari stated that providing military support to terrorist groups was not limited to the US-led coalition countries but Israel was in the lead of offering this support such as treating injured terrorists and providing medical care to them and launching airstrikes against Syrian army positions.\u201cThe direct Israeli support to ISIS through attacking Syrian army sites in Palmyra city on March 17, 2017 added fuel to the fire and made things worse. The \u00a0same scene on April 7, 2017 when the US administration and its allies felt that the terrorist groups began to retreat, so they committed their flagrant aggression against al-Shairat airbase under pretexts of using chemical weapons in the terrorist-held town of Khan Sheikhoun,\u201d he added.The US administration preceded its aggression with exploiting the UNSC international legitimacy mechanisms and submitted provocative draft resolutions which blame the Syrian government for using chemical weapons.This serious aggression had been plotted long in advance inside the secret rooms of intelligence agencies of Tel Aviv, Riyadh, Doha, Ankara, Amman, Washington, London and Paris. These are the same capitals which supplied their terrorist tools, on the top of which is Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, in Syria with toxic chemical materials to use them and accuse the Syrian government of using them, recalling what happened in Khan al-Asal on March 19, 2013, in the Eastern Ghouta on August 21th, 2013, in \u00a0Tal Mins on April 21,\u00a02014, in Sermin on March 16,2015 and in Qnaynas on March 16, 2016.Al-Jaafari affirmed that Damascus sent 90 letters to the UNSC on the possess of chemical weapons by terrorist groups with the aim of using them against civilians and accusing the Syrian government of committing these crimes, adding that some of those letters included the smuggling of sarin gas from Libya through Turkey to Syria on the board of an aircraft via a Syrian criminal, named Haitham al-Qassar.He indicated to statements made by former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas who was on a visit to London on June 2013 during which he was told about a conspiracy against Syria which aims at destroying the country and isolating its government due to its anti-Israel stances.He also referred to a report published on the British Daily Mail newspaper in January 2013 which contained emails between senior officials in British Britam Defense Company about a scheme approved by Washington that Qatar, in cooperation with Turkey, will fund terrorist groups in Syria to use chemical weapons, adding that documents released by WikiLeaks website proved that the White House has given green light to launch chemical attack in Eastern Ghouta in Damascus in order to blame the Syrian government and provoke taking an international military action against the country.Today, the new US administration, which claimed to give priority to counterterrorism and we have felt optimistic about, has found no way but to resort to the trick of red line and fabricate the incident of toxic chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun to commit its aggression against Syria, abort Astana and Geneva talks, rescue armed terrorist groups and help opposition groups withdraw from political settlement and counterterrorism obligations because we succeeded to add the basket of counterterrorism to the agenda of Geneva talks.\u201cThe enemies of the political track were not satisfied when we added the basket of combating terrorism to Geneva talks and the US new administration, along with its allies, did not find a pretext except the chemical weapons. In paradox, those who destroyed Syrian chemical weapons were the US ships in the Mediterranean,\u201d he said.This has taken place as the Syrian army and its allies gain victory over terrorism and local reconciliations are being achieved across the Syrian areas, not to mention the important steps that have been made in Astana meetings where de Mistura laid stress on Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity which means controlling borders with neighboring countries, particularly Turkey and Jordan, preventing the flow of terrorists, halting hostilities, separating armed groups from Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS terrorist organizations and unifying efforts in the war on terrorism. There are the outcomes of Astana talks.. if they were implemented, the crisis in Syria would have ended\u00a0within 24 hours.It has occurred in a time when serious efforts have been exerted in Geneva talks to crystallize a political vision and draw a road map to settle the crisis in Syria, a time during which Syria is witnessing a diplomatic openness and visits of parliamentary delegations, including western delegations, which start to show the public opinion what is really taking place in Syria and call for providing support to the Syrian government in its war against terrorism.\u201cI would like to leave this question to those who still resort to the logic and law in this Council in order to explain this blind madness and savage appetite to set Syria and the region on fire and lead international law into new phase of wars and conflicts in which only terrorism, extremism, hatred, military force and the law of jungle will gain victory,\u201d al-Jaafari said.Al-Jaafari said that in the face of this deception, the Syrian government sent a letter indicating an invitation to the Director General of the Organization of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Hague \u00a0to dispatch a mission to Khan Sheikhoun and al-Shairat airbase to find out the reality which means that we, the Syrian government, want to know who used the chemical gas in Syria.He pointed out that the Syrian government, in the last round of talks in Geneva, has submitted several papers to de Mistura, the most important of which entitled \u201cEssential Principles of a Political Solution in Syria\u201d which calls for finding a logical and natural ground to start discussing all issues, in addition to another paper on combating terrorism.Al-Jaafari said that all topics enlisted on the agenda have been discussed during the nine days of talks in Geneva, indicating to the absence of serious partner who seeks to fight terrorism and reach a political solution.He stressed Syria\u2019s denunciation of the US, France and Britain\u2019s endeavors to abort the Special Envoy\u2019s effort and hinder the Geneva and Astana talks in which the Syrian government has taken part as to shoulder its responsibility towards its people in defending the country and stopping blood-shedding.The diplomat\u00a0 noted that the US aggression will not deter the Syrian government and its allies from continuing its war on terrorism, actively participating in next rounds of Astana and Geneva talks or discussing issues related to governance, constitution, elections and counterterrorism, adding that the Syrian government will spare no effort to reach a political solution with the Syrians themselves are to determine their future and choice in a way that guarantees Syria\u2019s sovereignty, independence, safety and territorial integrity.\u201cI am surprised by the statements made by the representatives of France, Britain and the United States about their intention to submit a draft resolution for vote before conducting an honest international investigation on the chemical attack, which is considered as a provocative step and a misuse of the Security Council mechanisms,\u201d he said.For his part, Russian Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Vladimir Safronkov said that his country will not allow any destructive geopolitical projects to pass through the UN Security Council.He called for conducting a comprehensive investigation on Khan Sheikhoun incident, expressing astonishment at French experts who have not inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack and found that Damascus is behind the attack, wondering how do they know that?Safronkov said that such provocative acts like what has happened in Khan Sheikhoun enhance the positions of parties who seek a military solution to the crisis in Syria.He noted that Russia has effectively participated in the round of Syrian talks held in Geneva in March and encouraged all parties to look for solutions that are acceptable to all of them and reach settlements, expressing support to de Mistura and hoping that he would further \u00a0intense these efforts.The diplomat said\u00a0that the UK statement aimed to complicate de Mistura\u2019s efforts and prevent the political process from moving forward.Addressing the Britain\u2019s representative to the UN, Safronkov said \u201cWhat have you done to enhance the ceasefire agreement? You have welcomed the opposition groups in Paris and London. They are armed and illegal groups.\u201dThe Russian diplomat said that we should cooperate with all Syrian national parties in the talks and exert more efforts to ensure a comprehensive process and guarantee that Syria will remain a united secular state in which all spectrums of society can co-exist and contribute to the rebuilding of their country.The Russian diplomat called for forming an international alliance to dismantle mines in Syria.He said that many are thinking about the future of Syria after the crisis, the return of refugees and displaced people is the response to all terrorist practices rather than excluding Damascus and representatives of the Syrian Arab Republic from the whole process which is unprofessional, unacceptable and immoral.Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations, Liu Jieyi said that China will continue work with the international community and play a constructive and positive role to push forward the process to reach a comprehensive and fair political solution to the crisis in Syria.For his part, Bolivia\u2019s Representative to the UN said that any unilateral procedure will undermine the talks and hinder achieving peace in Syria, urging the need to unify efforts against terrorism.He added that the terrorists are the first beneficiary of the UN Security Council\u2019s inability to end this war, expressing condemnation of any terrorist act and calling for combating terrorism according to the UN Charter and all relevant UNSC resolutions.The diplomat highlighted his country\u2019s support to Astana and Geneva talks, reaffirming that the only way to get out of the crisis in Syria is through political solution and holding serious, constructive and honest talks.He called for acting in line with the UN Charter and conducting a comprehensive impartial independent investigation on the chemical attack.Kazakhstan\u2019s representative stressed that Geneva talks are the only means to reach a peaceful solution and put an end to the crisis in Syria, calling upon all parties to achieve settlement and go ahead with the political process.He added that the crisis in Syria affects the whole region, stressing the need that all parties in the region should work together to prevent any deterioration\u00a0in the situation and guarantee respecting the cessation of hostilities agreement.R.Raslan/Mazen/Ghossoun\u00a0"},

These papers are about finding logical and natural grounds for addressing constitution issues. Of course, during these eight days we discussed in headlines the four baskets which are governance, constitution , elections, and terrorism, in addition to the basic principles paper which was part of our discussion about each of the four baskets,\u201d he said.Al-Jaafari noted that the delegation posed a number of queries about issues that the Special Envoy had brought up before and during this round, and in turn the delegation gave de Mistura papers to submit to the other sides or platforms on the basis that Geneva is based on Syrian-Syrian dialogue via a UN mediator.\u201cRegretably, this round is voer and we haven\u2019t received the response of the other sides or platforms to any paper of our papers. This is no longer surprising because they don\u2019t want to fight terrorism and they don\u2019t want a political solution unless this political solution is tailored to their delusions which the years and facts proved that they never have and never will be realized,\u201d he explained, adding that those sides only had one delusion in their minds which is handing over the keys to Syria and the power to them.\u201cThey foamed and frothed, as they say in Arabic, during this round, ceaselessly making silly and tiresome statements showcasing their deviant opinions and twisted logic as if they\u2019re contestants on one of those TV shows where competitors seek to win votes like Arab Idol or the Voice, to the point that we felt that Geneva has become hosted on satellite channels and not in the halls of Syrian-Syrian dialogue without external interference,\u201d al-Jaafari elaborated.He went on to say that this once again reveals that these sides are in a state of adolescence when it comes to politics, the situation on the ground, and mass media, in addition to proving that they are agents of external forces and traitors to their homeland Syria, adding \u201csince they are tools and mercenaries in the hand of their operators and masters, it seems that they haven\u2019t received orders yet, except orders to support terrorism, cause ruckus and disturbance, and disrupt the entire round in clear reflection of the faces of their operators who support terrorism and who want to derail the Astana and Geneva tracks.\u201dAl-Jaafari pointed out that despite all of that, the Syrian Arab Republic delegation completed this round of dialogue with utmost seriousness, patience, and responsibility, because it bears the responsibility of defending Syria and stopping the bloodshed, adding \u201cthe mercenaries and traitors and those who live in Riyadh, Ankara, Doha, and other capitals cannot feel the pains and sufferings of the Syrian people.\u201dHe stressed the importance of continuing to hold the Astana and Geneva meetings and insuring the success of the Russian and Iranian efforts on the Astana track, as these efforts contribute greatly to achieving steps in Geneva 6.Regarding the new American position towards Syria, al-Jaafari said that the evaluation of the US State Secretary is carried out in Damascus, and as for the statements of the new US ambassador to the UN, he said that all ambassadors at the Security Council must understand the goal and rules of the Geneva meetings which are based on the principle of the dialogue being intra-Syria without foreign interference, adding \u201csince the US ambassador is new to the Security Council, I think we must give her some time to digest the Syrian reality related to dialogue in Geneva and Astana. Syria\u2019s future is decided by the Syrians themselves, not by the US ambassador at the Security Council or any other ambassador.\u201dRegarding the date of the next round of Geneva dialogue, al-Jaafari said that they agreed with de Mistura to continue communications via diplomatic channels to specify that date, adding that discussing any subject other than the main headlines which are the four baskets and the basic principles papers requires reaching agreement on the headlines first, so no work team can be formed before reaching agreement on the basic principles.He said that the delegation had hoped to achieve more progress during this round but this didn\u2019t happen, but the fact that the four baskets and the basic principles paper were discussed is good in and of itself.In response to a question on media claims about reaching an agreement regarding Madaya, al-Zabadani, Kefraya, and al-Foua\u2019a with Iranian and Qatari sponsorship and with the Syrian state being out of the deal, al-Jaafari said \u201cI advise you to rid yourself of these delusions. Nothing can happen on Syrian territory without the knowledge and consent of the Syrian government, whether it\u2019s about the activities of the UN or international NGOs or something else, so we can never allow any Qatari activity on Syrian territory before the Syrian government agrees to this, particularly since Qatar is a sponsor of terrorism in Syria.\u201dHe went on to add that the issue of these four towns isn\u2019t something new, and the Syrian government has worked with friends, allies, and the UN to realize humanitarian achievements there, saying that the priority is Kefraya and al-Foua\u2019a that haven\u2019t received the needed humanitarian aid during the past four years, as the Syrian government has been airlifting aid to them via helicopters, and once the terrorists working for Qatar shot down a helicopter carrying exam papers for the high school certificate.Regarding the obstacles hindering progress in Geneva, al-Jaafari said that the first is the absence of a patriotic partner, and second is the lack of political will to achieve political progress among the sponsors of terrorism and the sponsors of the platforms participating in Geneva.As for the issue of abductees, al-Jaafari said that this issue is very important for the Syrian public opinion, which is why the delegation interacted positively with de Mistura\u2019s paper on fighting terrorism and presented a paper outlining the Syrian government\u2019s position regarding this issue, explaining that the issue of fighting terrorism covers the issue of abductees and detainees, but sadly other platforms didn\u2019t interact with the terrorism basket because their priorities were the delusions that their operators filled their heads with.\u201cSome of them and not all of them are terrorists by nature, this is why they clapped and cheered for the campaign of terrorism that started in Damascus, Hama, and Lattakia only a few days before we came to Geneva, deluding themselves into believing that they can exert political pressure with this terrorism. The strange thing is that the shelling stopped today in Damascus as if terrorists are selective in their shelling of Damascus; shelling one day and stopping on another according to the agenda in Geneva,\u201d he said.Al-Jaafari went on to state in response to another question that \u201cone does not pick his enemies, so we have nothing to do with the selection of other opposing platforms. We\u2019re not the ones who elected or picked or appointed the members of those platforms.\u201dHazem Sabbagh"},

What happened to do cast a shadow over Geneva, therefore the terrorist act in Homs isn\u2019t just a military terrorist act, but also a political terrorist act,\u201d al-Jaafari saidHe added that \u201cthis is the main reason that drives us to having the article of fighting terrorism as a priority in our agenda for the Geneva talks,\u201d and that the blood of Syrians is precious and those who shed it will pay dearly.\u201cWe made it clear with unambiguous words that we are ready to continue talks until dawn on the basis of the opposition platforms and de Mistura himself issuing a condemnation of the terrorist act in Homs today,\u201d al-Jaafari said, adding \u201cnaturally, issuing statements will not bring the victims back to life, but the condemnation will serve as a test for the platforms participating in the Geneva talks as moderate opposition, so that we can find out if these platforms are against terrorism or partners in it.He noted that he told de Mistura that they are seeking common grounds that open the door to discussing other topics, asking him \u201chow can we talk with anyone about anything if they don\u2019t condemn terrorism,\u201d and telling him that al-Nusra\u2019s goal is to derail the Geneva talks.\u201cWe won\u2019t fall into that trap, which is why we are keen on having partners that reject terrorism like the Syrian people do,\u201d al-Jaafari went on to say, adding that they explained to de Mistura for the hundredth time that it\u2019s not enough to deal with al-Nusra or ISIS or all the other groups affiliated to them that change their names on daily basis like a chameleon changes its color, because fighting terrorism must first go through addressing the sponsors of terrorism politically instead of inviting them to have front-row seats at the opening session.Al-Jaafari also said that next session was scheduled for Tuesday by de Mistura.In response to a question on some so-called opposition groups accusing the Syrian state of being responsible for the bombings in Homs, al-Jaafari said that these aren\u2019t opposition; they\u2019re terrorists and partners in terrorism.Regarding disagreements inside the \u201cRiyadh opposition\u201d delegation regarding handling what happened in Homs, he refrained to comment on what happens among members of one platform or another, saying that all these oppositions are divided among themselves.Asked whether the Homs bombings are attempts by certain regimes to reshuffle the cards in light of the Syrian Arab Army\u2019s achievements and political achievements, al-Jaafari said \u201cyes, we believe so, and the proof is the statements of the Saudi foreign minister and others,\u201d noting that the statements of al-Jubeir and the Turks about the need for a military solution or so-called \u201csafe zones\u201d show that there are governments involved in prompting al-Nusra to carry out the Homs bombings to derail the Geneva talks, which makes these governments sponsors of terrorism.Regarding the paper submitted by de Mistura on Friday, al-Jaafari said that this paper hasn\u2019t been discussed because what is currently being discussed is prioritizing fighting terrorism, and as for the conditions of meeting with the opposition, he said that there\u2019s one condition which is having a unified opposition delegation negotiating with the Syrian Arab Republic as a true patriotic partner, adding that this delegation must condemn terrorism and mustn\u2019t be working for a foreign agenda.On de Mistura\u2019s response to the call for a clear condemnation of the Homs bombings, al-Jaafari said that the bombings send a message from the sponsors of terrorism saying that they don\u2019t want the talks to succeed and that terrorism is stronger than politics, which is why he asked de Mistura to address the sponsors of terrorism directly and to demand they stop supporting terrorism, adding that the Envoy said he will attempt to relay these concepts to the other sides.In response to a question on whether discussing fighting terrorism with de Mistura constitutes abandoning the Astana track, al-Jaafari expressed belief in the Astana track, but he said that the issue of fighting terrorism can\u2019t be resolved only in Astana but also needs to be addressed in Geneva, New York, and all tracks, stressing that the use of terrorism as a political weapon to pressure political talks mustn\u2019t be permitted, because if the sponsors of terrorism prevail that means they prevailed over international law and chaos will ensue across the world.On whether ISIS channels Syrian funds to the sponsors of terrorism, he said that ISIS is primarily a terrorist medium, but it also acts as a real-estate and commercial medium working for the benefit of the sponsors of terrorism including the Turkish government, adding \u201cyou all remember the aerial photos taken by Russian satellites of hundreds of oil and gas trucks that were stealing oil and gas from Syria and headed to Turkey and from Turkey to Israel. These were ISIS trucks,\u201d adding that there is also the theft and illicit trafficking in Syrian and Iraqi archeological artifacts and that goes through Turkey to European markets.\u201cWe asked a Security Council sub-committee for fighting terrorism to investigate the fate of 32,000 new Toyota cars that were sold from Toyota Company to ISIS. How did these cars reach ISIS? After a year of asking that question, the answer was that Toyota sold these cars to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Turkey,\u201d he said.Earlier, in a brief statement to the reporters upon the Syrian Arab Republic delegation\u2019s arrival at the UN HQ, al-Jaafari made a comment on the series of terrorist suicide bombings that happened in Homs earlier in the morning and targeted two security centers, claiming the lives of 50 military and civilian persons.Al-Jaafari said the terrorist bombings in Homs are \u201ca message to Geneva from the patrons of terrorism.\u201d\u201cWe say to everybody \u2018the message has been delivered\u2019, and that this crime will not go unnoticed,\u201d he added.For his part, the UN envoy for Syria said Homs terrorist attacks aim at \u201cspoiling\u201d the Syrian talks in Geneva.Speaking to the reporters before meeting the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic, de Mistura said every time there are talks, they are spoilers who want to spoil the process, adding that this was expected.Shaza/H.

to the United Nations Bashar al-Jaafari said that Syria rejects the Canadian draft resolution on the situation in Aleppo which was submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, calling on the Assembly\u2019s presidency to obtain the opinion of Assembly\u2019s legal counselor.During a UN General Assembly\u2019s session for voting on the aforementioned Canadian draft resolution which calls for the cessation of combat activities in Aleppo without removing terrorists from it, al-Jaafari said that the practices of Canada\u2019s delegation and those who joined it highlight the huge gap between theory and practice with regard to states\u2019 sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity.Al-Jaafari added that Canada\u2019s delegation and its partners violated the sovereignty of Syria by calling for convening this session without consulting with the Syrian delegation, and that they also violated Article 12 of the UN Charter which states the inadmissibility of discussing any file in the absence of a UN Security Council request.He noted that Canada\u2019s delegation, which feigns caring for the Syrian people, had voted a few days ago against a draft resolution on condemning the Israeli occupation of the Golan and against a resolution that considers Israeli settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan illegal, and this blatant contradiction shows the ill intentions of those who submitted the draft resolution on Aleppo including Canada.Al-Jaafari pointed out that since day one, the Canadian government has participated in the so called \u201cinternational coalition\u201d against ISIS despite that this coalition is illegal and violates the Syrian sovereignty and destroys infrastructure, adding that Canadian aircrafts along those of the US, France, Britain, and Denmark destroyed infrastructure in Syria instead of targeting ISIS, instead killing innocent civilians and targeting schools, hospitals, and villages.He went on to note that the coalition targeted Syrian Arab Army positions that were preventing ISIS from expanding, asserting that the true goal of the coalition\u2019s airstrikes is to prevent the Iraqi and Syrian armies from closing in on terrorists.\u201cIt seems that the US administration doesn\u2019t learn from its mistakes, and today it insists on providing armed terrorist groups with all sorts of weapons including anti-air missiles, then they talk about security of civilian airplanes!\u201d Syria\u2019s Representative added.Al-Jaafari pointed out that the Canadian government, which claims to care for the interests of the Syrian people, along with many of those who adopted the resolution, impose unilateral economic sanctions that harm the Syrian people and limit the Syrian government\u2019s ability to provide the citizens\u2019 daily needs, asserting that Syrians never delegated those who presented this resolutions or anyone else to talk about their suffering, a suffering exacerbated by these same states that submitted the resolution.\u201cBefore calling for holding this meeting and submitting the draft resolution, the Canadian delegation and its partners should have listened to the harrowing tales accounts about the crimes of terrorist organizations that were told by tens of thousands of our people who were saved by the Syrian Army and its allies in Aleppo city during the past few days, \u201d he said, adding that they also should have acknowledged the achievement made by the Syrian Army and its allies who liberated more than 100,000 Syrian citizens from the clutches of Jabhat al-Nusra and provided them with food, medicine, and shelter.\u201cThe Canadian delegation should have looked at the photos of the bodies of scores of innocent civilians who had tried to flee areas controlled by the terrorists to the areas where the Syrian Army is located, who were killed by those \u2018moderate opposition\u2019 members, some of whom have the nationalities of states that sponsor the Canadian draft resolution,\u201d he added.Syria\u2019s Representative said that the Canadian draft resolution is a game of taking turns played by some delegations in the UN who call for endless meetings and adopt resolutions under various agendas for the sole purpose of supporting and protecting terrorists and pressuring the Syrian government and its allies.\u201cWe count neither on the neutrality of the Canada\u2019s permanent delegation nor the integrity of the Saudi, Turkish, and Qatari delegations whose governments sponsored terrorism in Syria\u2026 we also don\u2019t count on the audacity of the delegation of Israel which occupies the occupied Syrian Golan and supports terrorist groups in the disengagement zone, or on the arrogance of the US, British, and French delegations that continue to provide political, media, and military cover and support to terrorist groups in Syria.\u201d Al-Jaafari said.He concluded by saying that voting agaisnt the Canadian draft resolution will show states\u2019 rejection of exploiting the suffering of the Syrian people and will reflect their support for a political solution for the crisis in Syria and for the Syrian government\u2019s right and duty to fight terrorism.The General Assembly voted in favor of the non-binding resolution, and after the voting al-Jaafari said that this resolution is politicized and violates the UN Charter, voicing regret over its adoption.He said that the statements made by certain states prove that they don\u2019t care about the humanitarian situation in Aleppo and that all they want is to support al-Nusra and other terrorist groups they back.Syria\u2019s Representative said that all the desperate attempts to distort facts via fabricated reports and to exploit the UN to serve destructive agendas will not dissuade the Syrian government and its allies from fighting terrorism, affirming that \u201cthe states sponsoring terrorism will not assassinate the dreams and future of the Syrian people, and the Syrian government and its army and allies will restore security, stability, development, and prosperity to every inch of Syria, and that reconstruction process will not see the participation of any sponsor of terrorism.\u201d\u201cI would like to reassure the states that sponsor terrorism in Aleppo that the Syrian Army has up to this point liberated 93% of the areas that terrorists used to control in Aleppo city, and their bloody games is taking its last breaths,\u201d he said, asserting that the liberation of the entirety of Aleppo will be achieved very soon.\u201cMy advice to the sponsors of terrorism and terrorists in Aleppo is to find a wall to cry at like grounded children and on which to suspend their frustration, failure, and defeat. Their bloody terrorist game in Syria and in Aleppo is over,\u201d al-Jaafari went on to say, adding that they should admit defeat as the paltry, ridiculous, unjust, and politicized resolution adopted today will not change the fact that they were defeated.He also thanked the states that acted with independence and respected international law by voting against the resolution or abstaining from voting.For his part, China\u2019s Representative said that the unilateral work for imposing pressure and politicizing the humanitarian situation in Syria will complicate the problem, considering that counterterrorism is an important part of the discussions on the crisis in Syria.He called upon the international community to adopt unified criteria for countering all groups designated by UNSC as terrorist and concentrating on counterterrorism in Syria, pointing out to his country\u2019s constructive role in seeking a solution to the crisis in Syria and finding a political solution as soon as possible.The Chinese Envoy stressed that any initiative should respect Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and should aim at solving problems and not complicating them through the four tracks which are cessation of hostilities, resumption of the intra-Syrian dialogue, counterterrorism and the humanitarian assistance.He pointed out that the situation in Aleppo and the humanitarian situation in Syria in a general view are not separated and in order to tackle them, we should adopt an integral approach and give a central role for the United Nations as a mediator and coordinator as to exert the required efforts for reaching a fair and sustainable solution to the crisis in Syria.The Iranian Representative to the UN, on his part, considered that the draft resolution is unilateral and very far from what is taking place in Syria and that it contradicts with the reality.He stressed that the reason behind terrorism and the violent extremism is some of the foreign states which support terrorists and open the door wide before them.The Iranian representative said that the main source of the suffering of the civilians is the practices of the terrorist organizations which sow fear and terror among the civilians through using them as human shields.English bulletin"},

We want to play without fear of mortar shells or explosive devices.. We want to live in peace, security and joy.. The blood of our friends who were martyred in different Syrian cities will not have been in vain, rather they will be a beacon for close victory on terrorism.It seems that the UNICEF representative did not hear about this letter and Jabhat al-Nusra representatives inside and outside the UN Security Council did not listen to the tens of thousands of liberated civilians\u2019 suffering stories and terrifying testimonies about the practices of Jabhat al-Nusra and affiliated terrorist groups in Aleppo over the past few years starting from selling humanitarian aid and bread to them, recruiting children, taking women captive and using them as human shields, Al-Jaafari added, noting that these are real stories and have nothing to do with stories from the Thousand and One Nights told by some states in this council.Addressing the US permanent representative, Al-Jaafari said that ISIS, Jabat al-Nusra and other terrorist groups who have taken women captive, set a price list to sell them at the slave market according to their age.The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, and Stephen O\u2019Brien, USG for Humanitarian Affairs at the UNSC did not use the word \u201cterrorists\u201d and used the expression \u201cNon-state armed groups\u201d when they talked about preventing civilians from leaving Aleppo eastern neighborhoods , stressing that this shows clearly that these terrorist groups take civilians as human shields, noted Al-Jaafari.He referred to the absurdity of some parties in the UNSC through their misleading statements which go in line with the stances of their governments and their destructive schemes, noting that it will not delude the reality that the people of some eastern neighborhoods in Aleppo restored hope in life after they were liberated by the Syrian army and its allies who provided them with food, safe residence and good living conditions after four years of suffering and pain.Al-Jaafari said that the \u201cabsurd theater\u201d and its heroes of Jabhat al-Nusra representatives inside the UNSC failed to distort the military achievement in liberating the civilians of Aleppo from terrorists, not to mention their failure in defaming the image of the relief and humanitarian performance of the Syrian government, in cooperation with its allies and friends, in order to provide them with their basic needs.Al-Jaafari said that \u201cIn this regard, the Syrian government submitted a request to the office of the UN Resident Representative in Damascus asking for taking part in relief efforts exerted by the government in order to alleviate the suffering of tens of thousands of Aleppo people, in addition to informing the UN resident representative in Aleppo to use the reserves at the UN warehouses in the city to meet the citizens\u2019 basic needs,\u201d noting that the UN resident representative will go to Aleppo on Thursday as the Syrian authorities approved it.He hailed Russia\u2019s efforts and support to Syria in its war on terrorism which extended to include the relief and humanitarian work, the latest of which is the Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s order to the Ministries of Defense and Emergency Situations to send mobile hospitals to provide medical assistance to residents of Aleppo and residential areas near it, noting that these\u00a0field \u00a0hospitals are real and not studios to fabricate heroic deeds such as of the so-called \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d terrorists founded by the British security consultant James Le Mesurier .It is time that this \u201cabsurd theater\u201d stop its practices which caused the unprecedented spread of \u00a0terrorism and terrified the international public opinion as it extended to almost all parts of the world, said Al-Jaafari, pointing out that these states have to realize that they cannot use terrorism to turn Aleppo in another Kandahar.He slammed the stances of some countries that abandoned their responsibilities towards the implementation of \u00a0the UN Security Council\u2019s relevant resolutions, particularly No. 2253, turning a blind eye to behaviors of some countries represented by extending unlimited financial and media support to the terrorists.He criticized the Qatari Foreign Minister\u2019s statements last Monday on his Sheikhdom\u2019s \u00a0continued support to the terrorists and arming them in Syria even if the upcoming American administration stopped this support.He lashed out at the destructive role of Israel through supporting the terrorist organizations at the disengagement area in the occupied Syrian Golan and in the surroundings of Daraa city, mainly Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization.The late Israeli aggression on al-Sabourah area in the western countryside of Damascus is \u201ca desperate attempt\u201d by Israel to raise the collapsed morals of Takfiri terrorist organizations upon which heavy losses were inflicted in many areas, particularly in the western countryside of Damascus.Al-Jaafari reiterated the call upon the Council\u2019s member states who sympathize with the \u201cgenetically modified moderate terrorists\u201d to bring back their brutal garbage which they have exported to Syria over the past five years and to take care of them if they want through establishing self-governing zones for them in their own cities in Europe, the US and other areas.He reiterated the Syrian Government\u2019s adherence to its policies which are built on balancing between the priority of combating terrorism as the main threat to security and stability in Syria, and seeking to find a political solution to the crisis based on the Syrian-Syrian dialogue under a Syrian leadership and without any foreign interference or any preconditions.He indicated that the Syrian Government is still waiting the invitation of the UN Special Envoy to Syria to resume the Syrian dialogue which stopped since May 2016.Al-Jaafari added that those who are invited today to the Security Council to estimate what is taking place in Aleppo have been hosted by each of London, Geneva and Amman while there has been no representative or deputy of the UN from Syria, indicating that this is a very dangerous gab as the UN representatives working in Damascus have been excluded from proposing their briefings to the Council.Russia\u2019s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said that his country vehemently condemns any attempts to protect or support terrorists in Syria under political pretexts, reiterating its rejection of the use of humanitarian pretext to achieve any political objectives.Churkin made his remarks following the British-French draft resolution on Aleppo submitted at the UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday.He added that the separation of the \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d from terrorists has been a main condition to halt the fight in Aleppo, but our western partners could not fulfill their promises to separate them and continue to use terrorists.He wondered about the role of the UN as 200 thousands of civilians are still besieged in Deir Ezzor province and get only 1% of the humanitarian aid.Churkin noted that the western-backed terrorist groups are on the verge to collapse in Aleppo and the Syrian Arab army has achieved a moral victory thereHe indicated that the western mass media has distorted the facts in Syria, reminding that the international community has overlooked the besieged people in the Iraqi Mosul city and Yemen.He expressed Russia\u2019s approval on any attempt to support humanitarian efforts in Aleppo, pointing out that Moscow provides assistance to the civilians in the city.\nFor his part, the UN Special Envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura said that

No government in the world would allow that,\u201d al-Moallem added.Al-Moallem pointed out that de Mistura talked about \u201cself-administration\u201d in eastern Aleppo is which is categorically rejected.\u201cIs it possible that the United Nations has come to reward the terrorists who are still firing random shells at Western Aleppo which claimed the lives of thousands of people and wounded many others?\u201d al-Moallem said.\u201cAnd today, a shell was fired at al-Furkan School, killing 11 students. Does it make sense to reward them? Moreover, terrorists also bombed the Justice Palace, the Faculty of Law and al-Bassel Hospital. Those terrorists do not have a moral deterrent,\u201d he added.The Minster reaffirmed that the idea of \u201cself-administration\u201d is totally rejected \u201cbecause it undermines Syria\u2019s national sovereignty and gives a reward for terrorism,\u201d adding \u201cSyria gave three truce opportunities for evacuating the residents from the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo, but terrorist organizations did not allow them to get out through the safe corridors, and they bombed the corridors with mortar shells and prevented civilians from leaving despite all the preparations carried out by Aleppo Governorate to secure them out safely.\u201dThe minister continued by saying that \u201c they were given more than a chance and they did not seize them, and now you are hearing about locals\u2019 demonstrations about food warehouses which are guarded by terrorists who are selling food on the black market to our people in eastern Aleppo.\u201d\u201cEven humanitarian convoys have been prevented by mortars.

special session to discuss the humanitarian situation in Aleppo city, northern Syria.Syria\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN Bashar al-Jaafari briefed the session on the latest developments in Aleppo and the announcement of a unilateral pause in hostilities for humanitarian purposes in the eastern parts of the city in the framework of the Russian-Syrian coordination.He clarified that the humanitarian pause aims at allowing the evacuation of wounded, sick and elderly people from the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo city, a mission facilitated by a team consisting of the UN organizations operating in Damascus, headed by the UN Resident Coordinator, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.Al-Jaafari went on saying that the Syrian government has opened six corridors for evacuating civilians and two corridors for gunmen who are willing to leave and have their legal status settled.He pointed out that the departure of civilians and gunmen was hindered due to attacks launched by the terrorist organizations, mainly Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham, on these corridors and residential areas in Aleppo in which sniper fire and shells were used.Al-Jaafari informed the UN General Assembly session that the terrorist organizations executed 14 persons in Aleppo city because they called on families to leave the neighborhoods controlled by the terrorists.These organizations, he added, also threatened to kill those who would leave the city and burn down their houses.He elaborated by noting that the terrorist organizations in the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo city, which are mainly made up of 27 factions, either belonging to Jabhat al-Nusra or allied with al-Qaeda, ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, had rejected all humanitarian initiatives, including the Russian-U.S. agreement signed in September 9, 2016, the initiative of the Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura and the latest Syrian-Russian initiative announced on October 10.Having stated all the above mentioned facts, al-Jaafari stressed that the Syrian government will continue to cooperate with the UN in delivering humanitarian aid to all Syrian citizens affected by the crisis wherever they are and without discrimination.A most recent example of this continued cooperation was delivering humanitarian aid to unstable areas, including the western parts of Harasta, Qudssaya, Douma and al-Tall, said al-Jaafari, noting that work is underway to follow up on implementing the response plan for November in cooperation with the UN.Syria\u2019s UN Representative addressed questions to the General Assembly wondering how it is possible to improve the humanitarian situation in Syria when the coercive economic measures imposed on the Syrian people continue and when mercenary terrorists continue to flow into Syrian territory in tens of thousands across the border with Turkey.He also wondered how there has been no progress in implementing the UN Security Council resolutions no. 2170, 2178, 2199 and 2253 that are related to combating terrorism.Al-Jaafari dismissed the talk about allowing the terrorist groups to stay in civilian-populated regions and establish self-administered areas as collaboration with terrorism, noting that the fact that the locals welcomed the Syrian army in the areas where reconciliations were achieved only proves that those locals had been against having their neighborhoods controlled by the gunmen.For his part, Russia\u2019s UN Permanent Representative Vitaly Churkin addressed the session saying that the US has supported with money and weapons those who took up arms against the Syrian state, who later joined ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, noting that the humanitarian situation would improve if that support stopped.Churkin affirmed it was time that the US met its obligations of separating the terrorists from what it calls \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d.The Chinese Permanent Representative to the UN Liu Jieyi expressed his welcoming of the Russian-Syrian humanitarian pause in Aleppo, stressing that the international efforts in Syria should be focused on fighting terrorism, launching political talks and delivering humanitarian aid.The unilateral humanitarian pause in Aleppo was also welcomed by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who said the pause could help in paving the way for implementing the medical evacuation plan of the UN.De Mistura also welcomed the humanitarian pause, saying it should be used by the UN and its partners to evacuate the injured and those who are willing to leave Aleppo and allow in medical and humanitarian assistance.He noted that there were attacks by the terrorists that targeted the UN bodies in Syria.De Mistura revealed a plan for a \u201ccomprehensive

The last few weeks, terrifying pictures have come out from Aleppo. I mean, we see the residents of the rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo in a very dire situation. They seem exhausted, they seem terrified, the situation is very violent. What is the strategy behind launching such fierce attack from the Syrian and Russian armies at the moment?President Assad: Actually, we didn\u2019t launch an attack, because the Syrian Army has continued its drive toward liberating every part of Syria including Aleppo or eastern Aleppo from the terrorists, but there was a ceasefire for one week in order to give the treaty, or the agreement, let\u2019s say, between the Russians and the Americans a way to be implemented, and it didn\u2019t work. When that week ended, we continued our drive as army to liberate eastern Aleppo from the terrorists. But actually, when you want to talk about the dire situation in eastern Aleppo, it\u2019s not because of the government; it\u2019s because of the terrorists. They\u2019ve been in that area for years now, but we only heard about that \u201cdire situation\u201d in the media recently, in the Western media, because the situation of the terrorists is very bad. This is the only reason. While if you want to talk about the situation there, we never prevented any medical supply or food supply or any other thing from entering east Aleppo. There\u2019s no embargo, if that\u2019s what you mean, there\u2019s no embargo, and our role as a government is to encircle the terrorists in order to liberate every part of the city.Question 2: But what I also mean, we see pictures of children being killed, children at hospitals, we see pictures of demolished hospitals. Who\u2019s targeting those hospitals?President Assad: Let me tell you something about those pictures of children; of course, in every war, there are victims, there are innocent victims, and that\u2019s why every war is a bad war, but if you look at those pictures that they\u2019ve been promoted as pictures in the Western media, they only singled out a few pictures of children that suit their political agenda, just to accuse the Syrian government, while \u2013 you\u2019ve been here now for two days \u2013 and they\u2019ve been daily shelling from the eastern part of Aleppo toward the rest of the city, and there was wholesale killing and destruction of the other part of the city and tens of victims and tens of wounded people from Aleppo that the Western corporations didn\u2019t talk about them. The Western officials didn\u2019t issue a single statement regarding those children and women and elderly and innocents in general. So, this is part of the propaganda and demonization of the government in Syria. That doesn\u2019t mean when you have war, again, that you don\u2019t have victims, but the Syrian government has opened the door for the militants in the eastern part of Aleppo to leave safely with guarantees, and for the people of that area to go back to their houses.Question 3: But residents in the area, eyewitnesses, international aid organizations, all saying that the hospitals have been targeted, and when I look at the pictures, I see hospitals, I see the beds inside the hospitals, and to me it really looks like it is demolished, it has been targeted, so who\u2019s targeting the hospitals?President Assad: I don\u2019t have the answer to which hospital are you talking about, because we don\u2019t have any facts about it, we only have allegations, so answering allegations shouldn\u2019t be only through-Question 4: But pictures are facts.President Assad: Pictures cannot tell you the story, even videos, everything could be manipulated these days. I wouldn\u2019t say that there are no such attacks on any building, but as a government, we don\u2019t have a policy to destroy hospitals or schools or any such facility for a simple reason: first of all, morally, the second reason is that if we do so, we are offering the militants the incubator, the social incubator that they\u2019ve been looking for, it\u2019s going to be a gift, something we wouldn\u2019t do because it\u2019s against our interests. It\u2019s like shooting ourselves in the foot. If there\u2019s such an attack from the army, it could be by mistake, but we don\u2019t have any information that thing has happened. All what we have is allegations and only in the Western media, not from Syria.Question 5: So, if the Syrian Army didn\u2019t attack hospitals, or maybe they did by mistake, you say, are you sure it\u2019s not the Russian air force who are targeting hospitals?President Assad: The question that you should ask when you have a crime: who is the beneficiary of that crime? What would they get, I mean for the Russians or the Syrians, if they attack a school or if they attack hospital? What would they get if they attack a hospital? Nothing, they wouldn\u2019t get anything. I mean, even if you want to talk about the terrorists, most of their hospitals for the militants would be in the basement in ordinary buildings. So, attacking a hospital intentionally by the army is based on shaky logic, let\u2019s say.Question 6: Do you then agree that whoever attacks hospitals, they are guilty of war crimes?President Assad: Of course, by international law, it is. I mean, hospitals have immunity. Any other facility for any inhabited area \u2013 inhabited by civilians, not by militants \u2013 has immunity, and any government shouldn\u2019t do it, of course, I agree with you.Question 7: Mr. President, you have kids yourself, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re also watching television, you also watch these pictures of children at the hospitals, children being buried in the rubble. How does it affect you when you look at these pictures of Syrian children?President Assad: Of course, I have children, I have the same feelings of any father and mother who would care a lot about their children, and how would they feel if they lose a member of their family. And by the way, we lost members of our families during the conflict because of the terrorist attacks. But when you look at those killed children, you think why? Why the terrorists did so? Why did Qatar and Saudi Arabia and Turkey commit those crimes? And I wonder why would the Western countries, mainly the USA and its allies in Europe, have supported those terrorists who\u2019ve been committing crimes in Syria? That\u2019s the first thing I thought about. Of course, as President, the second thing that I would think about is how can I protect the Syrian people and the Syrian children, and how can I protect the innocent from having the same fate in any coming day.Question 8: So, you are blaming the rebels in the eastern part of Aleppo of being behind the attacks on the children of Aleppo?President Assad: You can take your camera to Aleppo, to the other part of Aleppo which is under the control of the government, which is \u2013 I mean, when you see the fact, it\u2019s more credible than what I\u2019m going to say \u2013 but you can see how many civilians have been killed during the last two months in Aleppo. Hundreds of civilians have been killed by the rebels. The question is why didn\u2019t we hear about them in the Western media? That\u2019s my question. Again, I wouldn\u2019t say that you don\u2019t having civilians going as victims, but when it\u2019s shelled by mortars by the rebels intentionally, we have to talk about this crime as well.Question 9: At the moment, there\u2019s a seven-year-old girl, her name is Bana al-Abed, from Aleppo. She\u2019s Tweeting about her life in the eastern part of Aleppo. She\u2019s talking about the massive bombardment. She\u2019s very scared, every time she wakes up and realizes, fortunately, she\u2019s still alive. Do you trust her as an eyewitness?President Assad: You cannot build your political position or stand, let\u2019s say, according to a video promoted by the terrorists or their supporters. It\u2019s a game now, a game of propaganda, it\u2019s a game of media. You can see anything, and you can be sympathetic with every picture and every video you see. But our mission as a government is to deal with the reality. You have terrorists in Syria, they are supported by foreign powers and foreign countries, and we have to defend our country. In some areas, the terrorists use the civilians as a human shield, but we have to do our job to liberate them, we cannot say \u201cwe won\u2019t do anything because the terrorists are holding those hostages.\u201d It\u2019s our mission. Again, we are going to the same point; you always have mistakes that are committed by anyone, but this is not policy, and you always have innocent victims of that war.Question 10: What kind of mistakes did the Syrian Army do?President Assad: Any individual mistakes.Question 11: Have you any examples of mistakes?President Assad: I mean, you have institutions, I mean anyone could be punished if he commits a mistake, that would happen in any war, in every army, this is common sense.Question 12: You have encouraged the civilians in the eastern part of Aleppo, and also actually the rebels, to leave the place. You wanted to create a humanitarian corridor. Can you guarantee the safety of those civilians and the rebels if they leave the rebel-held part of the city?President Assad: Exactly, that\u2019s what we announced a few days ago, and we announced it two months ago, because we wanted the civilians to leave away from the terrorists. Yeah.Question 13: And how are you going to protect them?President Assad: They are allowed to leave. It happened many times, in many different areas in Syria. We allowed the terrorists to leave that area in order to protect the civilians. We don\u2019t need any more blood-letting and blood-shedding. This is one of the ways or the methods we\u2019ve been using in order to protect the civilians. Of course, if they don\u2019t obey, we tell the civilians that we\u2019re going to attack that area, so they can move away from it. But the best way is to allow the terrorists to leave, and the civilians will be safe, then you can if you want to follow or chase the terrorists, you can chase them somewhere else where there\u2019s no civilians.Question 14: Do you understand if people around the world who are watching these terrifying pictures coming out of the eastern part of Aleppo, if they maybe think that you are denying facts? That you also have some kind of responsibility for the victims, for the bombing of the hospitals, for the bombing of the civilian infrastructure? Do you understand that some people, they may think you are denying facts?President Assad: Look, if we\u2019ve been faced by lies since the beginning of the war on Syria, accepting those lies as reality doesn\u2019t make me credible. I wouldn\u2019t be credible if I say \u201coh, yeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d That\u2019s why I said there\u2019s a difference between accepting that this is a policy, or accepting that they always have mistakes. I didn\u2019t deny any mistake to be committed by any individual. I said there\u2019s always mistakes. There are always mistakes committed in any war. So, I\u2019m very realistic. But to say that this is our aim as a government, we give the order to destroy hospitals or schools or to kill civilians, this is against our interests. I mean, if you want to put the morals aside, we wouldn\u2019t do it because this is against us, so how can those people, that would say that we are only denying facts, convince anyone that we are working against our interests?This is first. Second, if we are killing people, Syrian people, and destroying hospitals and committing all these atrocities, and we\u2019ve been faced by all the great powers and the petrodollars in the world, how can I be President after nearly six years of the beginning of the war? I\u2019m not Superman, if I don\u2019t have support, I wouldn\u2019t be here, and because I have the support, and because we defend the Syrian people, we have the support as President or as a government. This is how to refute all these claims. I mean, at the end, the reality is telling.Question 15: So, there\u2019s a fierce battle going on in Aleppo right now. What will be the Syrian army and the Russian army\u2019s next move to retake the eastern rebel-held part of Aleppo?President Assad: To continue the fight with the rebels till they leave Aleppo. They have to. There\u2019s no other option. We won\u2019t accept that terrorists will take control of any part of Syria, not only Aleppo. This is our mission, and this is our goal, and this is our next step.Question 16: So, this intense way of warfare that we see right will continue, that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying?President Assad: No, if you have any other option like the reconciliations in other areas, that\u2019s the best option, not the war, and that\u2019s why we announced \u2013 we gave many amnesties to hundreds, and maybe thousands, not hundreds, thousands of militants, in order to save blood, and it worked. That\u2019s why we said we give them guarantee, whether they want to have reconciliation and to have the amnesty, or to leave with their armaments outside the city of Aleppo completely, to leave the city safe, and for the people to go back to their normal life.Question 17: The United States, they stopped all bilateral talks with Russia about any kind of peace agreement, and the Russians they said that they actually regret this. Do you regret it as well?President Assad: We regret it, but we knew in advance that it wouldn\u2019t work, because the agreement, it\u2019s not only about the talks between the two great powers, it\u2019s not about what they\u2019re going to sign or agree upon; it\u2019s about the will, and we already knew, we had already known that the Americans didn\u2019t have the will to reach any agreement, because the main part of that agreement is to attack al-Nusra which is, according to the American list and to the United Nations list, is a terrorist group, but in the Syrian conflict, it\u2019s an American card. Without al-Nusra, the Americans cannot have any real, let\u2019s say, concrete and effective card in the Syrian arena. That\u2019s why we regret it, but we already knew that it wouldn\u2019t happen.Question 18: But isn\u2019t it very difficult for the United States to separate the so-called \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d and some of the more radical ones? This is very difficult, when you are attacking the moderate rebels all the time.President Assad: You are right, do you know why you are right? Do you know the unicorn, the animal that\u2019s like a horse, has a long horn? It\u2019s a myth. And the moderate opposition is a myth. That\u2019s why you cannot separate something that doesn\u2019t exist from something that exists. All of them have the same grassroots, the same grassroots that used to be called \u201cfree Syrian army\u201d four years ago, five years ago, then it became al-Nusra, then it became ISIS. So, the same grassroots move from group to another group. That\u2019s why they cannot separate it. And they don\u2019t want.. if this is reality, not a myth, they don\u2019t want, but they cannot, because it doesn\u2019t exist.Question 19: But why did you ask them to do it if it\u2019s not possible?President Assad: Because they insisted that there is a moderate opposition, and the Russian told them \u201cok, if there is a moderate opposition, please separate those moderates from the extremists,\u201d and it didn\u2019t work, because they don\u2019t exist, that\u2019s why.Question 20: What do you think will be the consequences of the US suspension of the bilateral talks? I mean, until now, the Syrian and Russian armies, they have avoided direct clashes with the US army. Do you think that there\u2019s an increased risk of direct attacks between you and your allies and the US army?President Assad: Many people are talking about the escalation, if the agreement didn\u2019t work or if it\u2019s not implemented. But actually that escalation has been happening for a while now. I mean, before that agreement, let\u2019s say, failed, the Americans attacked our forces in Deir Ezzor, and everybody knows that only one group existed in Deir Ezzor, which is ISIS, and ISIS came and took the place of the Syrian Army and they threaten the city, which is called Deir Ezzor, because of the American attacks. So, talking about escalation, it\u2019s already happening. Talking about direct confrontation, since World War II, that never happened, I mean, it was very close to happening during the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962 I think. Now the situation is different, because in the United States you don\u2019t have superior statecraft. When you don\u2019t have superior statecraft, you should expect anything, and you should always expect the worse. I\u2019m sure that Russia is doing its best not to reach that point, but do the Americans \u2013 or, let\u2019s say, the \u201chawks\u201d part or the group within the administration \u2013 do their best to avoid that confrontation, or the opposite, do their best to have this confrontation with Russia? That\u2019s what worries us.Question 21: And talking about the incident in Deir Ezzor on September 17. It was British, Australian, US, and Danish fighter jets who allegedly attacked the Syrian Army. Denmark, like the other countries, they said it was a mistake. Do you accept that explanation?President Assad: We accept the explanation, but that doesn\u2019t mean we accept that error, doesn\u2019t mean we justify it. To say a mistake, maybe you have the wrong information, especially as you are fulfilling an American mission; I\u2019m sure not the Danish, not the British, decided which target they should attack. I\u2019m sure the Americans said \u201cthis is our target, and this is where ISIS is.\u201d Of course, they deceive the others, and tell them \u201cwe\u2019re going to attack ISIS.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s the truth. But is it acceptable for the Danish people that your army is fulfilling military missions of other countries without verifying the target and knowing where is it heading? Do you take a bus without knowing where the bus is going to? You don\u2019t. So, it\u2019s not acceptable. Maybe it\u2019s a mistake, that\u2019s true, but the mistake is not acceptable.Question 22: So do you think that, indirectly, Denmark, they were helping ISIS?President Assad: In reality, they helped ISIS because of this attack, because they killed tens of Syrian soldiers who are defending the city of Deir Ezzor from being under the control of ISIS, and now ISIS took the place, took the hills that overlook the city, so they could be able someday to take control of Deir Ezzor because of that attack.Question 23: And you think that the US, they did that on purpose, and Denmark, they helped them without knowing?President Assad: I don\u2019t know about Denmark; I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s without knowing. Maybe. The only reason that makes me believe so is because the Europeans implement and fulfill what the Americans want in every field without asking and without discussing, to be frank, so it could be one of the reasons. But for the Americans, a hundred percent, they did it intentionally, because ISIS gathered their militants in the same place before the attack, and when the attack started, it took about one hour, and in the next hour ISIS attacked and took control of those hills. How could ISIS knew about this raid before it happened? Of course, this is not the only indication for us that the United States is supporting ISIS, the attack on Palmyra, when they occupied and took control of Palmyra under the supervision of the Americans, the smuggling of oil, the extraction of oil from oil fields in Syria in the desert in the middle of the day. This is a strong indication that the United States has been supporting ISIS in order to use ISIS.Question 24: Until now, the Danish government they have followed US policy towards Syria. They even said that they were willing to engage in a military operation against the Syrian Army. What do you think about the Danish policy towards Syria?President Assad: First of all, the intervention in Syria, as part of the international coalition which is actually an American coalition, this is against the international law, this is against the sovereignty of Syria because this is not in coordination with the Syrian government, while the Russian came to Syria after taking the permission of the Syrians; actually after having an invitation from the Syrian government to support us in our fight against the terror. So this is against the sovereignty, this is against the international law and this is against any moralized policy anywhere in the world. It\u2019s illegal.The other aspect of that policy is the embargo. As part of the European Union, they made embargo on the Syrian population; tens of millions of Syrians, they are not allowed to reach the basic needs of their life. For example, you cannot buy now pumps for the water, they cannot buy medical equipment to diagnose somebody who has a cancer who would die because he cannot afford these materials. The embargo prevents the Syrian companies, airlines companies, from having spare parts for their airplanes in order to prevent those airplanes from crashing in the air and killing the passengers. This is the policy of the European Union, and Denmark is part of that policy.Question 25: But what else should they do? I mean, they are very much against what\u2019s going on in Syria right now. They have been supporting the opposition. Maybe they don\u2019t want to be involved in a direct war with the Syrian Army. So what else to do?President Assad: For the government?Journalist: Yes.President Assad: The question is would you as a Danish citizen accept me as a foreigner to support opposition in your country with money and to tell them \u201cgo and kill, and that\u2019s how you achieve your political goals?\u201d If there is opposition, what is the definition of opposition? Could you accept an opposition in your country that belongs to other countries? Or should it be a Danish opposition that belongs to Danish people. They cannot tell which opposition to support in any other country. This is an intervention in internal matters. This is against the sovereignty, against the international law. They don\u2019t have the right to support anyone in Syria against anyone. It\u2019s not their business. We are a sovereign country; we are independent. We have the right to tackle our problems. So, they\u2019re not in a position to support anyone, whether right or wrong.Question 26: Do you see Denmark as an enemy of Syria?President Assad: No, they are not. They are not an enemy. There is a big difference between the Danish people, like most of the European people, they were friends to Syria, but it\u2019s about the policy of the government. It\u2019s about whole Europe now being absent from the political map at least since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq, just because they had to follow the Americans, and they don\u2019t dare to take their independent, let\u2019s say, path in politics. We differentiate precisely between the government and the people of Denmark, and the same for other countries.Question 27: If it could speed up the negotiations for a peaceful future in Syria, if you left office and may be another one from the Syrian administration took over, why wouldn\u2019t you do that?President Assad: To leave, you mean?Journalist: Yes.President Assad: That depends on the Syrian people. It\u2019s not my decision. And if you don\u2019t have the support of the Syrian people, you have to leave right away, because without their support, you cannot achieve anything, you cannot produce anything, you are going to fail. So that\u2019s simply the reason, especially during the war you have to lead the ship to the shore; you don\u2019t run away because there is a war, unless the Syrian people want you to leave. If I\u2019m the problem, again, or the other point, let\u2019s say, or the other side of the story, if I\u2019m the reason of the war, I would leave. But it\u2019s not about me; I am just used as a nominal reason. It\u2019s much bigger than that; it\u2019s about Syria, it\u2019s about the government, it\u2019s about the independence, it is about the war on the regional level, it is about the war between the great powers. Syria is just the headline and the President is the main headline.Question 28: So you don\u2019t think that you are one of the reasons for the war?President Assad: No, I am not a reason for the war, because if I am a reason, the war should have started in 2000, since I became President, not 2011 when the money started pouring from Qatar and when the United States took the decision that they want topple governments and presidents because they do not suit them.Question 29: But don\u2019t you think you are the reason that the war escalated?President Assad: Because of me?Journalist: Yes.President Assad: So, the terrorists according to what you are saying, terrorists are not responsible, they are very peaceful people. The money of Qatar and Saudi Arabia and Turkey are something legal and natural, let\u2019s say, and the agenda of the United States fulfilled the needs of the Syrian people, which is not realistic.Question 30: Mr. President, you have said many times that you will continue the fight until you have recaptured the whole country, is that still your approach to this process?President Assad: No, it\u2019s not my approach; it\u2019s my mission according to the constitution. It\u2019s the mission of the army according to the constitution; it\u2019s the mission of the state\u2019s institutions according to the constitution. It\u2019s not an option, it\u2019s not a personal opinion, and it\u2019s not my plan. My mission is to defend the civilians. My mission is to fight terrorists. My mission is to take control of every part of my country. You don\u2019t take part of your country as a state. You don\u2019t say \u201cit is enough for me have half of the country\u201d or so.Question 31: So you think that you are defending the civilians?President Assad: Definitely.Question 32: I mean more than hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed; some people say 250 thousands; some people say 300 thousands. Do you think that you are defending the civilians in Syria?President Assad: The majority of those that you are talking about, the victims, are supporters of the government, not the opposite. Another part which is unbiased, in the middle, it doesn\u2019t belong to the government or to the other. So the majority are supporters. So, of course, I am defending the civilians. Again, otherwise if I\u2019m not, If I\u2019m killing the civilians, as the propaganda would promote for four years, I wouldn\u2019t be here as President. I cannot withstand for nearly six years.Question 33: Last question, Mr. President: Do you believe in a diplomatic political solution, or do you, deep inside your heart, know that this is going to be a military solution, and that is really what you want?President Assad: Neither, neither, because when you have a problem you have a solution, you don\u2019t have a kind of solution, but the problem itself will tell you how many aspects of that problems you have. For example, if I believe in political solution but you have terrorism, you cannot have a political solution because you have chaos. If you have chaos, this is the antithesis to anything natural, including the political process. So, you need first to fight terrorists in order to reach political solution. So, in reality, you have to follow both paths; the military and the diplomatic or the political, because they are related to each other. So, it\u2019s not about my belief; it\u2019s not what I believe; it\u2019s what the requirement of this conflict to be solved. So you don\u2019t define it. The whole circumstances define it. For example, regarding the terrorists, it\u2019s not only about military solution; it\u2019s about the adjacent countries and the Western countries stop supporting the terrorists. If they stop supporting them, the military aspect of that solution will be marginalized; it won\u2019t be important because they will be weak. You will give a chance to more political initiatives in that regard. If they support them more, actually what is going to happen is the opposite; the political solution or path will be marginalized. So, it\u2019s not about what I believe in. I wish we can solve everything politically, I wish, that\u2019s what I think is suitable, but it\u2019s not about what I wish, it\u2019s about the facts on the ground.Journalist: Thank you very much, Mr. President.President Assad: Thank you for coming.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"},

Are you prepared to go to early presidential elections?: This hasn\u2019t been proposed as part of the current political process. What is proposed is that after the constitution, there will be parliamentary elections. These parliamentary elections will show the size of political forces in the country, and consequently a new government will be formed according to the shares of political forces in the new parliament. Presidential elections are a completely different issue. This is linked to the popular situation in Syria. Is there a popular will for early presidential elections? If such will exist, I have no problem. This is natural when it comes in response to popular will, and not in response to some opposition forces. This issue touches every Syrian citizen because every citizen will have a vote concerning this president.So, in principle, I don\u2019t have a problem, because a president cannot act without popular support. And if such a president has popular support, he should be always prepared for such a step. So, I can say that in principle I don\u2019t have a problem, but in order to take this step, we need the popular opinion in Syria, not the opinion of the government or the president.: Nevertheless, Mr. President, the leader\u2019s opinion is important for his people. That\u2019s why I would like to ask you whether you agree to have the president elected by the parliament, as is the case in some countries. Have you reached an agreement for Syrians outside Syria to take part in electing the president? There is a lot of talk about this too. What is the method that you will adopt? What do you think is the most appropriate way for Syria?: I think it is better for us in Syria for the president to be elected directly by the citizens and not by parliament. This will free him from the influence of different political forces, and for his relationship to be subject only to the general popular condition. My personal opinion is that this will be better in this case. As to Syrians taking part in the elections, the wider the participation of the Syrians \u2013 everyone carrying a Syrian passport and identity card, the more powerful the elections will be through confirming the legitimacy of the state, the president, and the constitution which regulates this process. This includes every Syrian, in or outside Syria. But of course holding the elections outside Syria is a procedural matter and is not discussed as a political principle. Every Syrian citizen everywhere in the world has the right to vote, but we haven\u2019t yet discussed how these elections will be conducted, because the issue of early presidential elections hasn\u2019t been raised to start with. This is linked to the measures which will enable those to come to a voting station overseen by the Syrian state.: How do you assess the reconciliation process in the war in Syria? You have a lot of partners. Is it possible that there are groups with whom you are not prepared to discuss the future of Syria under any circumstances? Which groups are these? I would like also to ask about international peacekeeping forces. Are you prepared to accept such forces (UN forces) in order to make reconciliation more enduring?: The truce was relatively good, and better than many have expected, because it was expected to fail. We can say that the rate of the success of the truce was good or a little better than good. As you know there were negotiations between the Russians and the Americans in order to identify the terrorist groups, and there was no agreement about these groups. But for us and for the Russian side, we haven\u2019t changed our assessment concerning the terrorist groups. There was a proposal to avoid this pitfall to the effect that every group or organization which accepts the truce and moves towards dialogue, with the Russian side or the Syrian state, will be considered by us to have moved from terrorist action towards political action. This is what we try to achieve.That\u2019s why I believe that what is more important than classifying terrorist organizations now is to accelerate reconciliation and overreach processes with the militants who want to lay down their weapons or fight against terrorism with the Syrian state and the friends who support the Syrian state, particularly Russia and Iran.That\u2019s why for us as a state, the general principle is that we are prepared to accept any militant who wants to lay down his weapon, with the objective of bringing conditions back to normality and stop the Syrian bloodshed.: What about UN peacekeeping forces? Are you prepared to receive them in order to make this reconciliation more enduring?: This is unrealistic, because the work of such forces should be usually based on international agreements, and these agreements should be approved by states. So, what are these states? In this case, there are no states. There is only the Syrian state, as one side, while the other side is not a state but terrorist groups. Can the United Nations sign an agreement with terrorist groups? This is completely illogical.Even if they wanted to do that, what are these forces? They are unknown and unclear. You are talking about gangs which appear, disappear, merge with each other, and divide again against each other. So, it is an unclear situation. At the same time, from a military perspective, this requires two armies standing on the two sides of the borders with an agreement identifying accurately the geographical positions. All of that doesn\u2019t exist. So, if we agreed and brought in such forces, how would they act? That\u2019s why I say that this is not possible.: How do you measure what Russia, and its armed forces, is contributing to the military success in the war against terrorism in Syria?: I like to talk about facts on the ground. I might say that there has been a great success; and somebody else might say that there was little success. This differs according to the people involved. But let\u2019s conduct a simple comparison. How was the situation before the Russian intervention, when the Western coalition had been acting on the ground since it was created more than 18 months ago? Terrorism was expanding on a large scale in Syria and Iraq. And how has the position become six months after the Russian intervention? Terrorist forces are retreating, especially IS. So, reality says that the Russians have achieved a great success from our point of view, especially in the military field, in the battlefield, in defeating terrorism, to a great extent. In any case, the battle is not over yet and is still going on.: If we go back to the issue of Russian bases, Staffan de Mistura proposed in a plan he presented in Geneva a provision saying that there should be no foreign forces in Syria. Do you believe, for instance, that Syria will need the Hmeimim base permanently?: First, inviting foreign forces to a certain state is the right of that state. It is a sovereign right, and it exists in many countries of the world. So, no one can prevent this, unless there was a constitution which spells that out clearly and says that this state is not allowed to invite foreign forces. Such a constitution doesn\u2019t exist now, and I don\u2019t believe there is a public opinion in Syria that wants this Russian support to stop, whether now or in the future, and consequently the departure of Russian forces.The second point, in the present condition, we are still in the middle of the battle. It\u2019s not over yet. The answer should be about the Hmeimim base, and the size of the forces in it should be proportionate to the size of the tasks these forces carry out and the size of terrorism in Syria. Terrorism is still strong. It is true that we succeeded, with the Russian forces, to reduce the size of the areas in which it exists, but it is still strong and volunteers are still coming from outside Syria. Turkey continues to support terrorism, and so does Saudi Arabia and others. So, the size of the forces on the base should not be less than the force necessary to fight terrorism. After we defeat terrorism completely, there will be a different discussion. I believe that the Russian state itself will reduce the size of the forces which have no tasks to carry out, and there will be a different discussion.: But we have already reduced the size of these forces. Nevertheless, for many, the existence of the S-400 anti-aircraft system in Hmeimim is a cause for concern. In your opinion, until when will this system remain? Is there a timeframe? Have you asked Russia to give you this anti-aircraft system?: I believe that the parties which are annoyed by the Russian presence are annoyed because the Russian presence is fighting terrorism. Had President Putin decided to send his forces to support the terrorists, they would have applauded him. This is the problem with Western countries. The problem for them is not having a Russian base in this period.There is also another issue: they don\u2019t want a Russian presence on the international arena, neither politically, nor militarily, nor economically. So, any action taken by the Russian state and Russia, in its real position as a first-class superpower, and not a second-class one, as the Americans want Russia to be, any such act will annoy the West in general. This is why they are annoyed. As to keeping the Russian forces in Syria, as I said before, this is linked to the issue of fighting terrorism, and later to the geopolitical condition in the world.For us as a small state, and for many other small states, we feel safer and more comfortable when there is international balance. So, when part of this international balance is in the form of military action or military bases, we welcome it because it serves us in the political sense. This is a very important issue for us and for many countries in the world.: So, there is no talk about a timeframe for moving the S400 anti-aircraft system to the Syrian army now?: No, there\u2019s nothing now. And this is not linked to its being in Lattakia. This has to do with direct contracts between us and the Russian army, procurement contracts.: Can we identify the volume of the contracts according to which Russia provides military weapons to Syria and the Syrian Army? What are the newly-signed contracts?: In these circumstances, we focus on the weapons we need directly in fighting terrorism. This might be mainly medium and light weapons, and consequently we don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary now to focus on strategic weapons in this case and in this type of war. As to the volume, in the financial sense, we do not usually announce the volume of such contracts. This remains between the Syrian and Russian armies.: Could we move now to a more peaceful subject? How are you preparing for the parliamentary elections on April 13th? Are you comfortable with what\u2019s happening now?: The good thing is that after five years of war and attempts to destroy the Syrian state and strike at the structure which basically depends on the constitution, we can, despite all that, carry out constitutional measures. This proves that the state and the entity of the country are still there despite terrorism. The other thing, which is more positive for me personally, is the size of unprecedented participation in the parliamentary elections in Syria. It is the largest in terms of the number of candidates which reached many folds the numbers in previous elections. I believe that this can be attributed to the fact that Syrians still adhere to the constitution and is an expression of their desire to strengthen the legitimacy of their state and their constitution. This is a very powerful popular indicator. Consequently, I can say that in terms of the first and second factors, yes, I am comfortable.: Yet, the political process in Syria is taking place under conditions of a land intervention in the country. It might not be a fully-announced intervention, but Turkey is always shelling Syrian territory. Is there a red line after which you lose patience and deal with this as a direct aggression? Is there a red line which is being transgressed by intervening countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia which will force you to take tougher actions?: As for Turkey, first, and also for Saudi Arabia, from the first weeks, and probably from the first months of the war on Syria, they transgressed all the red lines. Everything they did from the beginning was an aggression, a political aggression and a military aggression through supporting and arming the terrorists, and an indirect aggression by their artillery shelling and sometimes their military violations.: What is Erdogan doing?: First, he is supporting terrorists directly. He allows them to move inside Turkey to carry out military exercises with their tanks, and not only as individuals. He provides them with money which comes from Saudi Arabia and Qatar through Turkey. He sells the oil stolen by IS. At the same time, he used to fire artillery shells to support the terrorists when the Syrian Army was advancing. He used to send Turkish terrorists to fight with other terrorists in Syria. This continues to happen. The aggression against the Russian aircraft in Syrian airspace was also an aggression against Syria, because that aircraft was in our airspace and consequently under Syrian sovereignty. He has done all these things from the beginning, in addition to his statements which constitute an intervention in internal affairs. Everything Erdogan has done is an aggression in every sense of the word. We can say that we have lost patience and lost hope a long time ago that this person might change. But today, the war against Erdogan and Saudi Arabia takes place through striking at the terrorists, for Erdogan\u2019s army, not the Turkish army, consists of the terrorists fighting in Syria today. When we strike at these terrorists in Syria, this will lead to defeating Erdogan directly. So, our response should be inside Syria first. I believe when we defeat terrorism, the Turkish people is not against Syria, and has no animosity towards Syria, the relations will be good. This is in case Erdogan remained in his place.: You visited Moscow last autumn with many issues to be discussed. What are the exact things you and President Putin agreed on? Have you signed any agreements? What are the provisions of your written agreement? Or do you continue to consult with each other based on a private relationship between you, which allows you not to write that down on paper?: That visit was conducted in special circumstances. It came a little less than two weeks before the beginning of the Russian support to Syrian forces. So, there\u2019s no doubt that this imposed itself on the visit\u2019s agenda. That was the main subject and the joint vision between President Putin and me about the next stage of fighting terrorism and political action. The visit concentrated solely on these two subjects. There were no agreements, just consultations and dialogue. We focused on two points: first, the military operation which started at that time, and the necessity to strike terrorism. The second point was how to use the military operation in support of the political process. President Putin\u2019s questions were about the same points you raised a short while ago, about our perception of the political process which might start in Geneva or in any other place at that time. These were the only subjects we discussed during that visit.: Mr. President, I\u2019m grateful to you for this candid interview. There might be something I should have asked but didn\u2019t, and you might want to add something.: First of all, I would like to thank you for visiting Syria in these particular circumstances; and I would like to say that I can convey, through your important media organization, the thanks of every Syrian citizen to every Russian citizen for the support extended by Russia to Syria during the crisis, whether the support was moral, humanitarian, or recently military. Every Russian citizen was a main supporter for President Putin in taking such a decision. Today, despite these difficult circumstances, we experience the joy of reclaiming the city of Palmyra which is part of the human heritage of the whole world. We believe that in addition to the Syrian Army, which was determined to reclaim it, Russia had a major role, in addition to Iran and the other forces fighting with Syria. Once again, I would like to thank every Russian citizen, through you, and to say that the relations we have built over a period of 60 years have become stronger and more solid. And we have a great hope for the Russian role on the global arena, and not only in Syria, in fighting terrorism and restoring balance to global politics. Thank you for coming."},

{"date": "Al-Moallem: Any intervention is an act of aggression, Syria will not comply with any precondition", "title": "6 February\u060c 2016", "text": "Damascus, SANA \u2013 Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign and Expatriates Minister Walid al-Moallem said Syria is ready to go for a Syrian- Syrian dialogue without any preconditions and will not comply with any precondition set by any party whatsoever.Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, al-Moallem said the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic to the talks in Geneva showed belief in the Syrians\u2019 right and Syria\u2019s future.He referred to Syria\u2019s reply message to the letter sent by UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura on January 26 inviting the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019s delegation to participate in the Syrian-Syrian dialogue.The Syrian letter, al-Moallem said, stressed the Republic\u2019s delegation\u2019s readiness to take part in the dialogue based on the two Vienna Communiqu\u00e9s and the Security Council resolution no. 2254 which state that the Syrian people alone have the right to determine their future and that dialogue should be Syrian- led and one among the Syrians away from foreign interference and without preconditions.Contrary to that, the statements of the \u201cRiyadh opposition\u201d delegation, even before they went to Geneva, were full of preconditions, including those about the humanitarian situation, said al-Moallem.When the three terrorist bombings happened in al-Sayyeda Zainab suburb near Damascus, the crime was internationally condemned, especially by the UN Secretary General, the Security Council and the European Union, he noted.\u201cOur delegation,\u201d al-Moallem said, \u201cthen wanted to put the Riyadh delegation to the test\u201d and asked for a condemnation statement of the crime, especially after a member of the Riyadh delegation\u201d named Salem al-Maslat accused the Syrian government of being behind the crime.The \u201cRiyadh opposition\u201d delegation however did not issue such a condemnation statement, as it was clear that they received no instruction to do so.Al-Moallem noted that the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019s delegation asked de Mistura to provide them with \u201ca list of the names of those with whom we were going to have dialogue, because we wouldn\u2019t hold dialogue with ghosts.\u201dThe list was only presented at the concluding session at the end of the talks, which had not even started, he explained.He said the \u201cRiyadh opposition\u201d delegation had already decided to walk out of the dialogue, particularly after the victories made by the Syrian Arab Army, mainly those in the northern countryside of Aleppo, referring to breaking the long time terrorist siege of Nubbul and al-Zahraa towns.\u201cWe hoped the Riyadh delegation, who talked about humanitarian issues, would feel happy just like our people were happy with breaking the three-and-a-half year siege of 70 thousand locals of Nubbul and al-Zahraa, but they packed their luggage and left,\u201d added al-Moallem.\u201cThey didn\u2019t feel happy simply because their affiliation is not to the [Syrian] people,\u201d he elaborated.He stressed that regardless of the Geneva track, the Syrian government pays the greatest attention to the humanitarian issues and to providing food and medical support to all its people, mainly those who are besieged by the armed groups and being used as human shields.The \u201cRiyadh opposition\u201d delegation, al-Moallem clarified, did not go to Geneva to engage in a Syrian-Syrian dialogue. \u201cThey went only because of the pressure practiced on them, and it was the decision of their operators of in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar to undermine the political process.\u201d\u201cAnyway, they did right walking out because they are not at all free to make decisions at the talks,\u201d he said.The Foreign Minister affirmed that everyone, on top of all de Mistura, should realize that \u201cSyria goes for a Syrian- Syrian dialogue without any preconditions and will not comply with any precondition set by any party whatsoever.\u201dHe noted that the two Vienna Communiqu\u00e9s and the Security Council resolutions assert de Mistura\u2019s responsibility of forming the opposition delegation and also stress on having the broadest possible representation of the opposition groups.However, al-Moallem said, de Mistura started picking names in a personal capacity and was being selective and named some of those whom he selected as advisors.He pointed out that the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic told de Mistura that it was important to not repeat the mistakes of Geneva 2 in that the representation of the opposition groups should be the broadest one possible in compliance with the resolution no. 2254, which cited the opposition groups of Moscow, Cairo and Riyadh.Al-Moallem found it strange that de Mistura did not meet with the delegation of the opposition from inside Syria, wondering why those have not been represented, when they have stayed in Syria all through the past period and they are national opposition who have ideas different from those of the government.\u201cWe want the broadest possible representation of the Syria opposition groups in Geneva conference, including the Kurds, because we want an applicable political solution that can be implemented on the ground,\u201d he stressed.\u201cNo one in the opposition can claim to be the only representative of the whole opposition,\u201d he said, adding \u201cWe hope de Mistura would take this point into consideration if we wanted to have a real and healthy atmosphere and abide by the two Vienna communiqu\u00e9s and the Security Council\u2019s\nresolution.\u201dAbout de Mistura\u2019s role, al-Moallem said de Mistura is the facilitator of the dialogue process. \u2018We acknowledge only what comes out of the Syrian-Syrian dialogue\u2026and those who talk about assurances are mistaken,\u201d he added.In response to a question on Saudi regime\u2019s announcement that it was ready to send troops to Syria, al-Moallem said the Saudi statements did not come out of the blue, but came in natural response to demands based on research centers in the US and the U.S. Secretary of Defense\u2019s statements to form ground troops to fight ISIS because the US doesn\u2019t want to cooperate with the Syrian army that is fighting ISIS, adding that \u201cthe question to be asked is \u2018What has Saudi Arabia done in Yemen? Has it succeeded?\u2019 It has inflicted total destruction.\u201dThis announcement shows that Saudi Arabia is implementing the US will, said al-Moallem, adding that \u201cit seems that after the victories of the Syrian armed forces and its allies , the conspirators and financers\u00a0have got fed up with their tools on the ground who are reeling, and that they decided to get involved themselves.\u201dAl-Moallem, however, ruled out such a move, but still recalled \u201ctheir crazy decisions made not only against Yemen but also regarding other areas,\u201d noting that the mutual visits made by Erdogan and his Prime Minister and Chief of Staff to Riyadh indicate that \u201cthere is something being plotted under U.S. patronage.\u201d\u201cAny ground intervention in the Syrian territories without the government\u2019s approval would be an act of aggression that has to be confronted, and in that case confrontation will be every Syrian\u2019s duty,\u201d al-Moallem stressed, adding that \u201cAny aggressor will be sent back to their country in wooden boxes.\u201dHe noted that Erdogan has dreams about the Ottoman state and these dreams are fading on the ground, referring to the popular rejection which Erdogan received during his visit to Latin America.Minister al-Moallem reiterated Syria\u2019s belief that the political solution is the only way to solve the crisis in Syria, noting that \u201cWe don\u2019t link between what is taking place on the ground and the political work, and we are working in parallel in the fight against terrorism.\u201d\u201cThis issue is one thing and Geneva conference is another thing,\u201d he added.\u201cWe are very keen on Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial safety and ridding it of terrorism\u2026Aggressors who dare attack Syria, be them from Turkey, Saudi Arabia or other, will return in wooden coffins..We are a sovereign country and we will repel any violation,\u201d al-Moallem said in a stern warning.Answering a question about announced visits to Russia by government and opposition representatives, al-Moallem said the Syrian government has received no invitation for a Moscow 3 round of talks, indicating that the Syrian crisis can only be solved politically.\u201cWe are leaving no stone unturned to reach a solution. If Riyadh delegation comes or not, this is their own business,\u201d he added.He said that counterterrorism efforts run in parallel political work, vowing that no effort will be spared until eliminating terrorism, namely ISIS and al-Qaeda-linked organizations in Syria.Asked whether \u201cJaish al-Islam\u201d and \u201cAhrar al-Sham\u201d terrorist organizations have representatives in Geneva, al-Moallem said \u201cthe Russian position on this is clear. Those came in their individual capacity and not as representatives of terrorist organizations, which does not give them legitimacy.\u201dJordan\u2019s position on Syria remains unchanged as \u201cconvoys of terrorists are still crossing borders coming from Jordan to Syria and not the other way round. It is a one-way ticket. Because those who return to Jordan get killed, \u201che added, attributing the army\u2019s recent successes in the southern region to the bravery of the Syrian army and popular support it enjoys rather than a change in Jordan\u2019s stance.Commenting on the issue of ceasefire, al-Moallem echoed the Russian Foreign Minister\u2019s statements that this is not applicable until borders with Turkey are controlled. \u201cThe same holds true for Jordan\u2019s too,\u201d he added.Al-Moallem said, in reply to a question about UN-brokered agreement about ISIS evacuating areas south of Damascus, al-Moallem said the agreement stipulates that ISIS members leave al-Hajar al-Aswad area and the areas surrounding it for Raqqa with their families. Others, he said, have stayed behind due to ISIS lack of transportation to carry them to Raqqa.Al-Moallem denied the existence of Syrian intelligence cooperation against ISIS with France or Britain, saying Syria does not exploit counterterrorism to make political gains.Al-Moallem said the Syrian government is ready to provide humanitarian aid for the Syrians wherever they are, but said guarantees are needed to make sure that the aid will not end up in the hands of terrorists, citing the Russian and Syrian air force dropping more than 90 tons of humanitarian aid over areas controlled by ISIS in Deir Ezzor.Answering a question on when the crisis might come to an end, al-Moallem said as long as there are conspirators, who are still willing to spend their peoples\u2019 money on armed groups, no one can say for how long, adding \u201cHowever, with the army\u2019s achievements, we are moving towards the finish line of the crisis whether they like it or not.\u201dThe Foreign Minister called on those who haven\u2019t yet dropped their arms to go back to their senses and get back on the right track as they still have the chance because the Syrian army is able to win in any area.H.

We don\u2019t know until this moment who the other delegations that are supposed to represent the Syrian oppositions ,\u201d al-Jaafari elaborated.\u201cWe asked de Mistura to inform us of the names of those who are going to participate and to prepare the agenda of this dialogue or these indirect talks well,\u201d he added, noting that the Syrian Arab Republic delegation discussed with the UN Special Envoy the important press statement issued by the UN Security Council on Monday which denounced the terrorist bombings in Sayyeda Zainab area in Damascus Countryside which claimed the lives of scores of Syrians.\u201cThe Security Council and the Syrian government denounced the terrorist bombings, and it remains for us to hear the position of the other side regarding this terrorist massacre that took place the day before yesterday. If the other side actually cares about the lives of Syrians as it claims, we expect it to issue a statement denouncing this terrorist act,\u201d al-Jaafari said.Responding to a question, al-Jaafari stressed that all issues, whether humanitarian issues or combating terrorism, are priorities for the Syrian government and there can be no favoring of one issue over another, and as soon as indirect dialogue begins officially, all issues will be tackled.\u201cSo far, we\u2019re still in the procedural, preparatory framework of the indirect talks, meaning that we\u2019re waiting to know who are holding dialogue with, and so far nothing is clear. Will there be one delegation or two or three or four? There are no clear answers,\u201d he explained.Regarding the conflicting statements of the \u201cRiyadh opposition\u201d delegation, al-Jaafari said that they lack seriousness, and that some statements were made in Geneva by its representative saying that they will withdraw on Thursday unless their preconditions are met, and we also heard irresponsible confirmation of this from the Saudi foreign minister and from some of those who direct the other side.Al-Jaafari pointed out that the Syrian Arab Republic delegation arrived in Geneva on time according to the schedule set by de Mistura, and that the delegation showed discipline and didn\u2019t speak to the media before the procedural terms were clarified so as to remain accurate and avoid any misleading of the public opinion.He also made it clear that the delegation raised the issue of the participation of the two terrorist organizations of \u201cAhrar al-Cham\u201d and \u201cJaish al-Islam\u201d in the talks with de Mistura, and that the latter promised to discuss the issue with the other sides.Regarding de Mistura\u2019s statement on Monday that the talks have started officially, al-Jaafari said that this is de Mistura\u2019s interpretation of the conditions of the official launch of the negotiations, stating that the current stage is a preparatory stage because official talks require the attendance of all sides to be involved in the negotiations, something which is yet to take place.A meeting between the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic and UN Special Envoy for Syria was held earlier today at the UN headquarters in Geneva.In the same context, UN sources and other sources close to the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic indicated that the delegation presented through de Mistura a three-point demand, including that the Riyadh opposition issue a clear statement of condemnation of the terrorist bombings that took place in al-Sayyeda Zainab on Sunday and all acts of ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra and the terrorist organizations linked to them wherever they happen.The second point was to determine lists of the names of the opposition figures to hold the indirect dialogue with, and the third point was about the role of the other opposition groups present in Geneva, according to the sources, who noted that the delegation is awaiting the answer to the three-point demand.The sources said de Mistura promised to present the lists of opposition figures to the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019s delegation tomorrow, and that de Mistura stated that the current stage is a preliminary stage of the indirect dialogue, and once another delegation sits down with the mediator at the UN HQ, then only at that moment one can speak of an official start of the dialogue, and not now where there are only intermittent meetings.H.

{"date": "Al-Jaafari: Riyadh opposition delegation\u2019s delayed attendance at Geneva sign of lack of seriousness and responsibility", "title": "31 January\u060c 2016", "text": "Geneva, SANA \u2013 Dr. Bashar al-Jaafari, head of the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic to the Syrian-Syrian talks in Geneva, said on Sunday that the Riyadh opposition delegation\u2019s delayed attendance at Geneva, and the fact that the names of its members are unknown, are a sign of its lack of seriousness and responsibility.In a statement to the press in Geneva, al-Jaafari said that any political solution for the crisis in Syria can\u2019t be achieved without the presence of a serious party to the dialogue process, stressing that the interest of the Syrian people is the compass for the Syrian Arab Republic delegation in Geneva and must be the compass for dialogue.Al-Jaafari condemned the terrorist bombings that targeted Sayyeda Zainab area in Damascus Countryside earlier on Sunday and claimed the lives of 45 civilians, noting that a terrorist from the so-called \u201csouthern front\u201d said they will back the Riyadh delegation with military operations on the ground, which proves what the Syrian government had often stated about the link between the terrorists and their sponsors and operators on one side and some groups that claim to be against terrorism and label themselves as political groups on the other side.He voiced regret that these bombings mark the beginning of Geneva 3 on which the Syrian government and people are counting to end bloodshed and violence and move forward in a political process that fulfils the aspirations of the Syrian people in preserving Syria\u2019s territory, people, sovereignty, and independence.Al-Jaafari said that the Syrian Arab Republic delegation came to Geneva in answer to the invitation of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura to participate in indirect Syrian-Syrian dialogue with the goal of launching an inclusive political process as per international resolution no. 2254 without any preconditions or foreign interference, noting that the text of resolution no. 2254 and that of the invitation addressed to the Syrian government have not been respected, referring to the fact that the invitation stated that the dialogue will begin on January 25th, which didn\u2019t happen because the opposition groups\u2019 delegations delayed their arrival, which shows their lack of seriousness and responsibility at a time when Syrians are burdened with terrorist threats and inflammatory statements.He noted that the many political statements made by the head of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the foreign ministers of Britain, France, German, and Italy gives the impression that talks are being held with these states, not with other Syrians, which shows how fragile the position of the other sides are.\u201cThe Syrian Arab Republic delegation believes that any political solution for the crisis in Syria can\u2019t be achieved without the presence of a serious party to the dialogue process that is committed to serious work to realize the interest of the Syrian people alone, and not the interest of regional, Arab, and international capitals,\u201d al-Jaafari said, stressing that the interest of the Syrian people must be the compass for dialogue in Geneva.\u201cWe want to implement what was previously agreed on. We don\u2019t want to start from scratch as that would be a waste of time at the expense of the Syrian people\u2019s pains,\u201d he added, affirming that the Syrian Arab Republic delegation\u2019s primary concern is preserving the higher interest of the Syrian people, and not getting involved in details, trivialities, and absurdities that don\u2019t merit commenting on.Al-Jaafari said that during the meeting with de Mistura on Friday, the delegation outlined what the Syrian government has done to ease the suffering of the Syrian people despite the unilateral compulsory economic steps that are erroneously called \u201csanctions\u201d which are imposed by Arab, regional, and international sides, steps that lead to more suffering for Syrians.\u201cMany who were labeled refugees left the country not because the Syrian government is persecuting them, as some are trying to promote, but rather because they want to lead good lives and seek job opportunities and economic conditions that provide them and their families with decent living. Youths are immigrating and becoming expatriates because of these sanctions and compulsory steps that are imposed on the Syrian people and their economy,\u201d he explained.Al-Jaafari went on to say that the delegation raised this point with de Mistura and asked him to intervene with the states that impose those steps that violate the UN Charter because they were taken outside the Security Council and the UN General Assembly adopts resolutions each year on the illegal nature of these steps, adding that this isn\u2019t based only on Syria\u2019s viewpoint, but rather on a \u201clegal arsenal\u201d adopted by the UN General Assembly each year that asserts these steps are illegal.He also said that the delegation stressed to the UN Special Envoy readiness to work for finding a solution to end the crisis as long as there are parties with a serious will to work to that effect by holding dialogue among Syrians, and not by waiting for guarantees and promises from states that are escalating and maintaining the crisis.Al-Jaafari pointed out that throughout the past five years, the Syrian state did all it could to serve its people, from the humanitarian issue and fighting terrorism to making political initiatives and partaking in any proposition that seeks to end the crisis, adding \u201cthe government has proved its good intentions and positive attitude in each time, but the problem has always been with the other party.\u201dHe said that if the other party is serious and keen to stop violence and bloodshed, it should come to Geneva with a national agenda in line with the resolution no. 2254 and the two Vienna statements, which means becoming involved in Syrian-led inter-Syrian dialogue away from preconditions and any foreign interference.\u201cUp until this moment, we don\u2019t know and nobody knows who the other side is, not even de Mistura and his team. We are using the term \u2018oppositions\u2019 instead of \u2018opposition\u2019 because we will find before us several delegation, therefore the image isn\u2019t clear in a final manner,\u201d the head of the delegation said.Al-Jaafari said that certain regional, Arab, and international sides are trying to take things back to square one through insisting on imposing a delegation from the so-called \u201ccoalition\u201d which is the same thing that led to a dead end in Geneva 2.He said the failure to reach a list of the terrorist organizations and opposition groups is a key gap that is yet to be bridged, and that this failure is due to the fact that this task has been entrusted to Saudi Arabia and Jordan, two countries that are not neutral and that sponsor terrorism and are incapable of being objective, stressing that the first priority must be fighting terrorism, and this shouldn\u2019t be circumvented by giving terrorism new names, adding that terrorism is the cause of a large part of the humanitarian issues in Syria, so humanitarian issues cannot be dealt with without dealing with terrorism.\u201cWe will not hold dialogue with terrorists or deal with them, and this is why de Mistura insisted on indirect talks, because we don\u2019t know the names of the opposing delegations,\u201d al-Jaafari said, adding that this is also Russia\u2019s position, explaining that there won\u2019t be negotiations but rather indirect talks in the form of Syrian-Syrian dialogue without preconditions or foreign interference, asserting that those who propose preconditions are violating resolution no. 2254 and the Vienna statements.\u201cAs a government delegation, we have no preconditions to propose to anyone, and we don\u2019t have taboos. We are here to hold dialogue over any issue raised via de Mistura. Meanwhile, those who talk about preconditions are amateurs in politics and it means that they are coming to the Geneva meeting to undermine it, and that they aren\u2019t keen on the success of the Syrian-Syrian dialogue. It is also a sign of a fragile mentality, a lack of political experience, and lack of understanding of the resolution no. 2254 and the Vienna statements,\u201d he said.Al-Jaafari said the Syrian Arab Republic delegation has comprehensive knowledge of the pressing humanitarian issues which will be part of the dialogue, adding \u201cwe\u2019re not bargaining over the fate of Syrians, and when we talk about the humanitarian issue, we don\u2019t base our judgment on the bartering principle as the other side does. All the abductees and missing people and those whose families are inquiring about are an issue for all Syrians.\u201d\u201cIf the other side controls land in Syria, then they should tell us where are the abductees from Lattakia countryside, Adra al-Umaliya, Deir Ezzor, and other areas,\u201d he added.In response to a question on what is being called a transitional governing body, al-Jaafari said that the resolution no. 2254 doesn\u2019t mention such a body or an expanded national government; rather it talks of credible rule, something which is subject to Syrian-Syrian dialogue.He asserted that the Syrian government will continue to enforce the rule of law and confront terrorists, and it won\u2019t wait for others to do that because this is the duty of the government, adding that the compliance of terrorism-sponsoring states \u2013 mainly Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Israel \u2013 with international resolutions on counter-terrorism is essential for the progress of the political solution.\u201cHow can a terrorist from Australia or Chechnya or any other country become moderate opposition?\u201d Al-Jaafari wondered, adding that the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has arrested several officers, security personnel, prosecutors, and two journalists and accused them of treason for exposing the matter of the trucks carrying weapons which he sent to terrorists in Syria whom Erdogan labels \u201cmoderate opposition.\u201dEnglish Bulletin"},

{"date": "President al-Assad to Russian media outlets.. We cannot implement anything unless we defeat the terrorism.. The army is the most important symbol for any society", "title": "16 September\u060c 2015", "text": "Damascus, SANA- President Bashar al-Assad gave an interview to the Russian media outlets, following is the full text of the interview:: Mr. President, thank you for giving us all, from the Russian media, from RT, from Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Channel 1, Russia 24, RIA Novosti, and NTV channel. Thank you for giving us all the opportunity to talk to you during this very critical phase of the crisis in Syria, where there are many questions that need to be addressed on where exactly the political process to achieve peace in Syria is heading, what\u2019s the latest developments on the fight against ISIL, and the status of the Russian and Syrian partnership, and of course the enormous exodus of Syrian refugees that has been dominating headlines in Europe.Now, the crisis in Syria is entering its fifth year. You have defied all predictions by Western leaders that you would be ousted imminently, and continue to serve today as the President of the Syrian Arab Republic. Now, there has been a lot of speculation recently caused by reports that officials from your government met with officials from your adversary Saudi Arabia that caused speculation that the political process in Syria has entered a new phase, but then statements from Saudi Arabia that continue to insist on your departure suggest that in fact very little has changed despite the grave threat that groups like ISIL pose far beyond Syria\u2019s borders.So, what is your position on the political process? How do you feel about power sharing and working with those groups in the opposition that continue to say publically that there can be no political solution in Syria unless that includes your immediate departure? Have they sent you any signal that they are willing to team up with you and your government? In addition to that, since the beginning of the crisis in Syria, many of those groups were calling to you to carry out reforms and political change. But is such change even possible now under the current circumstances with the war and the ongoing spread of terror in Syria? Let me first divide this question. It\u2019s a multi question in one question. The first part regarding the political process, since the beginning of the crisis we adopted the dialogue approach, and there were many rounds of dialogue between Syrians in Syria, in Moscow, and in Geneva. Actually, the only step that has been made or achieved was in Moscow 2, not in Geneva, not in Moscow 1, and actually it\u2019s a partial step, it\u2019s not a full step, and that\u2019s natural because it\u2019s a big crisis. You cannot achieve solutions in a few hours or a few days. It\u2019s a step forward, and we are waiting for Moscow 3. I think we need to continue the dialogue between the Syrian entities, political entities or political currents, in parallel with fighting terrorism in order to achieve or reach a consensus about the future of Syria. So, that\u2019s what we have to continue.If I jump to the last part, because it\u2019s related to this one, is it possible to achieve anything taking into consideration the prevalence of terrorism in Syria and in Iraq and in the region in general? We have to continue dialogue in order to reach the consensus as I said, but if you want to implement anything real, it\u2019s impossible to do anything while you have people being killed, bloodletting hasn\u2019t stopped, people feel insecure. Let\u2019s say we sit together as Syrian political parties or powers and achieve a consensus regarding something in politics, in economy, in education, in health, in everything. How can we implement it if the priority of every single Syrian citizen is to be secure? So, we can achieve consensus, but we cannot implement unless we defeat the terrorism in Syria. We have to defeat terrorism, not only ISIS. I\u2019m talking about terrorism, because you have many organizations, mainly ISIS and al-Nusra that were announced as terrorist groups by the Security Council. So, this is regarding the political process. Sharing power, of course we already shared it with some part of the opposition that accepted to share it with us. A few years ago they joined the government. Although sharing power is related to the constitution, to the elections, mainly parliamentary elections, and of course representation of the Syrian people by those powers. But in spite of that, because of the crisis, we said let\u2019s share it now, let\u2019s do something, a step forward, no matter how effective. Regarding the refugee crisis, I will say now that Western dealing in the Western propaganda recently, mainly during the last week, regardless of the accusation that those refugees are fleeing the Syrian government, but they call it regime, of course. Actually, it\u2019s like the West now is crying for the refugees with one eye and aiming at them with a machinegun with the second one, because actually those refugees left Syria because of the terrorism, mainly because of the terrorists and because of the killing, and second because of the results of terrorism. When you have terrorism, and you have the destruction of the infrastructure, you won\u2019t have the basic needs of living, so many people leave because of the terrorism and because they want to earn their living somewhere in this world. So, the West is crying for them, and the West is supporting terrorists since the beginning of the crisis when it said that this was a peaceful uprising, when they said later it\u2019s moderate opposition, and now they say there is terrorism like al-Nusra and ISIS, but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president. So, as long as they follow this propaganda, they will have more refugees. So, it\u2019s not about that Europe didn\u2019t accept them or embrace them as refugees, it\u2019s about not dealing with the cause. If you are worried about them, stop supporting terrorists. That\u2019s what we think regarding the crisis. This is the core of the whole issue of refugees. Mr. President, you touched on the subject of the internal Syrian opposition in your first answer; nevertheless, I would like to go back once again because it\u2019s very important for Russia. What should the internal opposition do in order to cooperate and coordinate with Syrian authorities to support them in battle? This is what they are saying and what they intend to do. How do you see the prospects of Moscow 3 and Geneva 3? Will that be useful for Syria in the current situation? As you know, we are at war with terrorism, and this terrorism is supported by foreign powers. This means that we are in a state of complete war. I believe that any society and any patriotic individuals, and any parties which truly belong to the people should unite when there is a war against an enemy, whether the enemy was in the form of domestic terrorism or foreign terrorism. If we ask any Syrian today about what they want, the first thing they would say we want security and safety for every person and every family. So, we as political forces, whether inside or outside the government, should unite around what the Syrian people want. This means that we should first unite against terrorism. This is logical and self-evident. That\u2019s why I say that we have to unite now as political forces or government or as armed groups which fought against the government in order to fight terrorism. This has actually happened. There are forces fighting terrorism now with the Syrian state, which had previously fought against the Syrian state. We have made progress in this regard, but I would like to take this opportunity to call on all forces to unite against terrorism, because it is the way to achieve the political objectives which we as Syrians want through dialogue and political action.Concerning Moscow 3 and Geneva 3, in your opinion, are there prospects for this endeavor? The importance of Moscow 3 lies in the fact that it paves the way to Geneva 3, because the international sponsorship in Geneva was not neutral, while the Russian sponsorship is. It is not biased, and is based on international law and Security Council resolutions. Second, there are substantial differences around the \u201ctransitional body\u201d item in Geneva. Moscow 3 is required to solve these problems between the different Syrian parties; and when we reach Geneva 3, it is ensured that there is a Syrian consensus which would enable it to succeed. We believe that it is difficult for Geneva 3 to succeed unless Moscow 3 does. That\u2019s why we support holding this round of negotiations in Moscow after the preparations for the success of this round have been completed, particularly by the Russian officials. I would like to carry on with the issue of international cooperation in order to solve the Syrian crisis. In this regard, it is clear, after solving the Iranian nuclear file issue, that Iran will play a more active role in the region\u2019s affairs. In this context, how do you evaluate the recent Iranian initiatives concerning reaching a settlement for the situation in Syria? And in general, what is the importance of Tehran\u2019s support for you, is there military support? And in case there is, what form does it take? At present, there is no Iranian initiative. There are ideas or principles for an Iranian initiative based primarily on Syria\u2019s sovereignty, the decisions of the Syrian people, and on fighting terrorism. The relationship between Syria and Iran is an old one. It is over three and a half decades old. There is an alliance based on a great degree of trust. That\u2019s why we believe that the Iranian role is important. Iran supports Syria and the Syrian people. It stands with the Syrian state politically, economically, and militarily. When we say militarily, it doesn\u2019t mean as claimed by some in the Western media that Iran has sent an army or armed forces to Syria. This is not true. It sends us military equipment, and of course there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran. This has always been there, and it is natural for this cooperation to grow between the two countries in a state of war. Yes, Iranian support was essential to support Syria in its steadfastness in this difficult and ferocious war. Concerning the regional factors and actors, you recently talked about security coordination with Cairo in fighting terrorism, and that you are in the same battle line in this regard. How is your relationship with Cairo today given that it hosts some opposition groups? Do you have a direct relationship or perhaps through the Russian mediator, particularly in light of the strategic relations between Russia and Egypt. President el-Sisi has become a welcome guest in Moscow today. Relations between Syria and Egypt have not ceased to exist even in the past few years, and even when the president of Egypt was Mohammed Morsi who is a member of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood organization. Egyptian institutions insisted on maintaining a certain part of this relationship, first because the Egyptian people are fully aware of what is happening in Syria, and second because the battle we are fighting is practically against the same enemy. This has now become clearer to everyone. Terrorism has spread in Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and in some other Arab countries, and in some Muslim countries too like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and others. That\u2019s why I can say that there is joint vision between us and the Egyptians, but our relationship exists now on the security level. There are no political relations, i.e. there are no contacts between the Syrian Foreign Ministry and the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, for instance. Contacts are done on the security level only. We understand the pressures that might be applied on Egypt or on both Syria and Egypt so that they don\u2019t have a strong relationship. This relationship does not go, of course, through Moscow. As I said, this relationship has never ceased to exist, but we feel comfortable for the improvement in relations between Russia and Egypt. At the same time, there is a good, strong, and historical relation between Moscow and Damascus, so it is natural for Russia to feel comfortable for any positive development in relations between Syria and Egypt. Mr. President, allow me to go back to the question on fighting terrorism. How do you look at the idea of creating a region free of ISIS terrorists in the north of the country on the borders with Turkey? In this context, what is your comment on the indirect cooperation between the West and terrorist organizations like al-Nusra Front and other extremist groups? And with whom are you willing to cooperate and fight against ISIS terrorists? To say that the borders with Turkey should be free of terrorism means that terrorism is allowed in other regions. This is unacceptable. Terrorism should be eradicated everywhere; and we have been calling for three decades for an international coalition to fight terrorism. But as for Western cooperation with al-Nusra Front, this is a reality, because we know that Turkey supports al-Nusra and ISIS by providing them with arms, money, and terrorist volunteers. And it is well known that Turkey has close relations with the West. Erdogan and Davutoglu cannot make a single move without coordinating first with the United States and other Western countries. Al-Nusra and ISIS operate with such a force in the region under Western cover, because Western states have always believed that terrorism is a card they can put in their pocket and use from time to time. Now, they want to use al-Nusra just against ISIS, maybe because ISIS has gone out of control one way or another. But this doesn\u2019t mean that they want to eradicate ISIS. Had they wanted to do so, they would have been able to do it. For us, ISIS, al-Nusra, and all similar organizations which carry weapons and kill civilians are extremist organizations.But with whom do we conduct dialogue, is a very important question. From the beginning, we said that we engage in dialogue with any party if that dialogue leads to degrading terrorism and consequently achieve stability. This naturally includes the political powers, but there are also armed groups with whom we conducted a dialogue and reached agreements in troubled areas which have become quiet now. In other areas, these armed groups joined the Syrian Army and are fighting by its side, and some of their members fell martyrs. So, we talk to everyone except the organizations I mentioned like ISIS, al-Nusra, and similar ones for a simple reason which is that these organizations base their doctrine on terrorism. They are ideological organizations and are not simply opposed to the state as is the case with a number of armed groups. Their doctrine is based on terrorism, and consequently dialogue with such organizations cannot lead to any real result. We should fight and eradicate them completely and talking to them is absolutely futile. Certainly with friendly countries, particularly Russia and Iran. Also we are cooperating with Iraq because it is facing the same type of terrorism. As for other countries, we have no veto on any country provided that it has the will to fight terrorism and not as they are doing in what is called \u201cthe international coalition\u201d led by the United States. In fact, since this coalition started to operate, ISIS has been expanding. In other words, the coalition has failed and it has no real impact on the ground. At the same time, countries like Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Western countries which provide cover for terrorism like France, the United States, or others, cannot fight terrorism. You cannot be with and against terrorism at the same time. But if these countries decided to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion, if you put it in your pocket, it will sting you. If that happens, we have no objection to cooperating with all these countries, provided that it is a real and not a fake coalition to fight terrorism. What is the current condition of the Syrian Army? The Syrian Armed Forces have been fighting for over four years. Have they been exhausted by the war, or have they become stronger as a result of engagement in military operations? And are the reserve forces to support their activities? And I have another important question: you said that a large number of your former adversaries and adversaries of the Syrian Army have moved to your side and are fighting within the ranks of the government forces. What is their number? And what is the extent of the help they are extending in the fight against extremist groups? Of course, war is bad. And any war is destructive, any war weakens any society and any army no matter how strong or rich a country is. But things cannot be assessed in this manner. War is supposed to unite society against the enemy. The army becomes the most important symbol for any society when there is an aggression against this country. Society embraces the army, and provides it with all the necessary support, including human resources, volunteers, conscripts, in order to defend the homeland. At the same time, war provides a great deal of expertise to any armed forces practically and militarily. \u00a0So, there are always positive and negative aspects. We cannot say that the army becomes weaker or stronger. But in return, this social embrace and support for the army provides it with volunteers. So, in answer to your question. \u201cAre there reserves?\u201d Yes, certainly, for without such reserves, the army wouldn\u2019t have been able to stand for four and a half years in a very tough war, particularly that the enemy we are fighting today has unlimited human supply. We have terrorist fighters from over 80 or 90 countries today. You talk about a popular incubator in the millions in different countries sending individuals to fight in Syria with the terrorists. As far as we are concerned, our reserve force is Syria in the first instance. So, we have reserve forces, and this is what enables us to carry on. There is also determination. We have reserves not only in terms of human power, but in will as well. We are more determined than before to fight and defend our country against terrorists. This is what led some fighters who used to fight the state in the beginning for different reasons, and then discovered that they are wrong, so they decided to join the state. Now they are fighting battles with the army, and some have actually joined the army as regular soldiers. Some of them have kept their weapons, but they are fighting in groups with the armed forces in different parts of Syria. Mr. President, Russia has been fighting terrorism for 20 years, and we have seen its different manifestations. And now it seems that you are fighting it head on. In general, the world is witnessing now a new form of terrorism. In all the regions occupied by ISIS, they are setting up courts and administrations, and there are reports saying that it intends to mint its own currency. This way, they are constructing what looks like a state. This in itself might attract new supporters from different countries. Can you explain to us whom are you fighting? Is it a large group of terrorists or is it a new state which intends to radically redraw the borders of the region and the whole world? What is ISIS today? Of course, the terrorist ISIS groups tried to give the semblance of a state, as you said, in order to attract more volunteers who live on the dreams of the past: that there was an Islamic state acting for the sake or religion. This ideal appearance is unreal. It is deceptive. But no state can suddenly bring a new form to any society. The state should be the product of its society. It should be a natural evolution of that society, to express it. In the end, a state should be a projection of its society. You cannot bring a state which has a different form and implant it in a society. Here we ask the question: does ISIS, or what they call the Islamic State, have any semblance to Syrian society? Certainly not.Of course we have terrorist groups, but they are not an expression of society. In Russia, you have terrorist groups today, but they do not project the Russian society, nor do they have any semblance to the open and diverse Russian society. That\u2019s why if they tried to mint a currency or have stamps or passports, or have all these forms which indicate the existence of a state, it doesn\u2019t mean that they exist as a state, first because they are different from the people, and second because people in those regions flee towards the real state, the Syrian state, the national state. Sometimes they fight them too. A very small minority believes these lies. They are certainly not a state, they are a terrorist group. But if we want to ask about who they are, let\u2019s speak frankly. They are the third phase of the political or ideological poisons produced by the West, aimed at achieving political objectives. The first phase was the Muslim Brotherhood at the beginning of the last century. The second phase was Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in order to fight the Soviet Union. And the third phase is ISIS and al-Nusra Front and these groups. Who are ISIS? And who are these groups? They are simply extremist products of the West. Mr. President, at the beginning of the Syrian crisis, the Kurdish issue started to be discussed more often. Previously, Damascus was severely criticized because of its position towards the Kurdish minority. But now, practically, in some areas, Kurdish formations are your allies in the fight against ISIS. Do you have a specific position towards who the Kurds are for you and who you are for them? First, you cannot say that there was a certain state policy concerning the Kurds. A state cannot discriminate between members of its population; otherwise, this will create division in the country. If we had been discriminating between the different components of society, the majority of these components wouldn\u2019t have supported the state now, and the country would have disintegrated directly from the very beginning. For us, the Kurds are part of the Syrian fabric. They are not foreigners, they live in this region like the Arabs, the Circassians, the Armenians, and many other ethnicities and sects existing in Syria and living in it for many centuries. It\u2019s not known when some of them came to this region. Without these groups, there wouldn\u2019t have been a homogenous Syria. So, are they our allies today? No, they are patriotic people. But on the other hand, you cannot put all the Kurds in one category. Like any other Syrian component, there are different currents among them. They belong to different parties. There are those on the left and those on the right. There are tribes, and there are different groups. So, it is not objective to talk about the Kurds as one mass.There are certain Kurdish demands expressed by some parties, but there are no Kurdish demands for the Kurds. There are Kurds who are integrated fully into society; and I would like to stress that they are not allies at this stage, as some people would like to show. There are Kurdish soldiers in the army who have fallen martyrs, which means that they are fully integrated into society. But there are parties which had certain demands, and we addressed some of those demands at the beginning of the crisis. There are other demands which have nothing to do with the state, and which the state cannot address. There are things related to the whole people, to the constitution, and the people should endorse these demands before a decision can be taken by the state. In any case, anything proposed should be in the national framework. That\u2019s why I say that we are with the Kurds, and with other components, all of us in alliance to fight terrorism. This is what I have talked about a while ago, that we should unite in order to fight ISIS. After we defeat ISIS, al-Nusra, and the terrorists, the Kurdish demands expressed by certain Kurdish parties can be discussed nationally. There is no problem with that, we do not have a veto on any demand as long as it is within the framework of Syria\u2019s unity and the unity of the Syrian people and territory, fighting terrorism, Syrian diversity, and the freedom of this diversity in its ethnic, national, sectarian, and religious sense. Mr. President, you partially answered this question, but I would like to have a more precise answer, because some of the Kurdish forces in Syria call for amending the constitution. For instance, setting up local administration and then moving on to an autonomy in the northern regions. These statements are becoming more frequent now that the Kurds are fighting ISIS with a certain degree of success. Do you agree to such statements? Can the Kurds bet on some kind of gratitude? Can this be discussed? When we defend our country, we do not ask people to thank us. It is our natural duty to defend our country. If they deserve thanks, then every Syrian citizen defending his country deserves as much. But I believe that defending one\u2019s country is a duty, and when you carry out your duty, you don\u2019t need thanks. But what you have said is related to the Syrian constitution. Today, if you want to change the existing structure in your country, in Russia for instance, let\u2019s say to redraw the borders of the republics, or give one republic authorities different from those given to other republics; this has nothing to do with the president or the government. This has to do with the constitution. The president does not own the constitution and the government does not own the constitution. Only the people own the constitution, and consequently changing the constitution means national dialogue. For us, we don\u2019t have a problem with any demand. As a state, we do not have any objection to these issues as long as they do not infringe upon Syria\u2019s unity and diversity and the freedom of its citizens. But if there are certain groups or sections in Syria which have certain demands, these demands should be in the national framework, and in dialogue with the Syrian political forces. When the Syrian people agree on taking steps of this kind, which have to do with federalism, autonomy, decentralization, or changing the whole political system, this needs to be agreed upon by the Syrian people, and consequently amending the constitution. This is why these groups need to convince the Syrian people of their proposals. In this case, they are not in dialogue with the state, but rather with the people. When the Syrian people decide to move in a certain direction, and to approve a certain step, we will naturally approve it. Now, the U.S.-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes on Syrian territory for about one year on the same areas that the Syrian Air Force is also striking ISIL targets, yet there hasn\u2019t been a single incident of the U.S.-led coalition and the Syrian Air Force activity clashing with one another. Is there any direct or indirect coordination between your government and the U.S. coalition in the fight against ISIL? You\u2019d be surprised if I say no. I can tell you that my answer will be not realistic, to say now, while we are fighting the same, let\u2019s say enemy, while we\u2019re attacking the same target in the same area without any coordination and at the same time without any conflict. And actually this is strange, but this is reality. There\u2019s not a single coordination or contact between the Syrian government and the United States government or between the Syrian army and the U.S. army. This is because they cannot confess, they cannot accept the reality that we are the only power fighting ISIS on the ground. For them, maybe, if they deal or cooperate with the Syrian Army, this is like a recognition of our effectiveness in fighting ISIS. This is part of the willful blindness of the U.S. administration, unfortunately. So not event indirectly though, for example the Kurds? Because we know the U.S. is working with the Kurds, and the Kurds have some contacts with the Syrian government. So, not even any indirect coordination? Not even any third party, including the Iraqis, because before they started the attacks, they let us know through the Iraqis. Since then, not a single message or contact through any other party. Ok, so just a little bit further than that. You\u2019ve lived in the West, and you, at one time, moved in some of those circles with some Western leaders that since the beginning of the crisis have been backing armed groups who are fighting to see you overthrown. How do you feel about one day working again with those very same Western leaders, perhaps shaking hands with them? Would you ever be able to trust them again? First, it\u2019s not a personal relation; it\u2019s a relation between states, and when you talk about relation between states, you don\u2019t talk about trust; you talk about mechanism. So, trust is a very personal thing you cannot depend on in political relations between, let\u2019s say, people. I mean, you are responsible for, for example in Syria, for 23 million, and let\u2019s say in another country for tens of millions. You cannot put the fate of those tens of millions or maybe hundreds of millions on the trust of a single person, or two persons in two countries. So, there must be a mechanism. When you have a mechanism, you can talk about trust in a different way, not a personal way. This is first. Second, the main mission of any politician, or any government, president, prime minister, it doesn\u2019t matter, is to work for the interest of his people and the interest of his country. If any meeting or any handshaking with anyone in the world will bring benefit to the Syrian people, I have to do it, whether I like it or not. So, it\u2019s not about me, I accept it or I like it or whatever; it\u2019s about what the added value of this step that you\u2019re going to take. So yes, we are ready whenever there\u2019s the interest of the Syrians. I will do it, whatever it is. Talking about alliances in the fight against terrorism and ISIS, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a regional alliance to fight what is called the Islamic State, and the recent visits of Arab officials to Moscow come in this context, but Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said that this means a miracle. We are talking here about security coordination, as described by Damascus, in case it happened, with the governments of Jordan, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. How do you see this alliance? In your opinion, will it achieve any results? You just said that any relation is based on interests, so are you willing to coordinate with these countries, and what is the truth behind the meetings held between Syrian and maybe Saudi officials as reported by the media? As to fighting terrorism, this is a big and comprehensive issue which includes cultural and economic aspects. It obviously has security and military aspects as well. In terms of prevention, all the other aspects are more important than the security and military ones, but today, and in the reality we live now in terms of fighting terrorism, we are not facing terrorist groups, we are facing terrorist armies equipped with light, medium, and heavy weaponry. They have billions of dollars to recruit volunteers. The military and security aspects should be given priority at this stage. So, we think that this alliance should act in different areas, but to fight on the ground first. Naturally, this alliance should consist of states which believe in fighting terrorism and believe that their natural position should be against terrorism. In the current state of affairs, the person supporting terrorism cannot be the same person fighting terrorism. This is what these states are doing now. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Jordan, which pretend to be part of a coalition against terrorism in northern Syria actually support terrorism in the south, the north, and the northwest, virtually in the same regions in which they are supposed to be fighting terrorism. Once again I say that within the framework of public interest, if these states decided to go back to the right position, to go back to their sense and fight terrorism, naturally we will accept and cooperate with them and with others. We do not have a veto and we do not stick to anything in the past. Politics change all the time. It might change from bad to good, and the ally might become an adversary, and the adversary an ally. This is normal. When they fight against terrorism, we will cooperate with them. Mr. President, now there is a huge wave of refugees, largely from Syria, going to Europe. Some say that these people are practically lost to Syria. They are very unhappy with the Syrian authorities because they haven\u2019t been able to protect them and they had to leave their homes. How do you look at those people? Do you see them as part of the Syrian electorate in the future? Do you expect them to return? And the second question has to do with the European sense of guilt about the displacement happening now. Do you think that Europe is guilty in this regard? Any person who leaves Syria constitutes a loss to the homeland, to be sure, regardless of the position or capabilities of that person. This of course does not include the terrorists. It includes all citizens in general with the exception of terrorists. So, yes, there is a great loss as a result of immigration. You raised a question related to the elections.\u00a0 Last year, we had presidential elections in Syria, and there were many refugees in different countries, particularly in Lebanon. According to Western propaganda, all those had fled the state, the oppression of the state, and the killing of the state, and they are supposed to be the enemies of the state. But the surprise for Westerners was that most of those voted for the president who is supposed to be killing them. That was a great blow to Western propaganda. Of course, voting has certain conditions. There should be an embassy, and to have the custodianship of the Syrian state of the voting process. This depends on relations between the states. Many countries have severed relations with Syria and closed Syrian embassies, and consequently Syrian citizens cannot vote in these countries. They should go to other countries where ballot boxes are installed. But this did happen last year.As to Europe, of course it\u2019s guilty. Today, Europe is trying to say that Europe is guilty because they haven\u2019t given money or they haven\u2019t allowed these people to immigrate legally to Europe, and that\u2019s why they came through the sea and were drowned. We are sad for every innocent victim, but is the victim who drowns in the sea dearer to us than the victim killed in Syria? Are they dearer than innocent people whose heads are cut by the terrorists? Can you feel sad for a child\u2019s death in the sea and not for thousands of children who have been killed by the terrorists in Syria? And also for men, women, and the elderly? These European double standards are no longer acceptable. They have been flagrantly exposed. It doesn\u2019t make sense to feel sad for the death of certain people and not for the death of others. The principles are the same. So, Europe is responsible because it supported terrorism, as I said a short while ago, and is still supporting terrorism and providing cover for them. It still calls them \u201cmoderate\u201d and categorizes them into groups, while all these groups in Syria are extremists. If you don\u2019t mind, I would like to go back to the question about the political future of Syria. Mr. President, your opponents, whether those fighting against the authorities with weapons or your political opponents, still insist that one of the most important conditions for peace in the country is your departure from political life and from the position of the president of the republic. What do you think of this, not only in your capacity as president of the state, but as a Syrian citizen as well? Theoretically, are you prepared if you feel it is necessary? In addition to what you are saying, Western propaganda was from the very beginning about the idea that the cause of the problem is the president. Why? Because they want to portray that the whole problem of Syria lies in one individual, and consequently the natural reaction for many people is that if the problem lies in one individual, that individual should not be more important than the whole homeland. So, let that individual go, and things will be all right. This is how they oversimplify things in the West. What\u2019s happening in Syria, in this regard, is similar to what happened in your case. Notice what happened in the Western media since the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat started in the Ukraine. What happened? President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West to a foe, and once again he was characterized as a tsar. He is portrayed as a dictator suppressing opposition in Russia, and that he came to power through undemocratic means, despite the fact that he was elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic. Now, it is no longer democratic. This is Western propaganda. They say that if the president went, things will become better. What does that mean practically? For the West, it means that as long as you are there, we will continue to support terrorism, because the Western principle followed now in Syria and Russia and other countries is changing presidents, changing states, or what they call bringing regimes down. Why? Because they do not accept partners, and they do not accept independent states. What is their problem with Russia? What is their problem with Syria?\u00a0 What is their problem with Iran? They are all independent countries. They want a certain individual to go and be replaced by someone who acts in their interests and not in the interest of his country. For us, the president comes through the people and through elections, and if he goes, he goes through the people. He doesn\u2019t go as a result of an American decision, a Security Council decision, the Geneva conference or the Geneva communiqu\u00e9. If the people want him to stay, he should stay; and if the people reject him, he should leave immediately. This is the principle according to which I look at this issue.Military operations have been going on for over four years. You are likely to analyze things and look back often. In your opinion, was there a crucial juncture when you realized that war is unavoidable? And who initiated that war machinery? Is it the influence of Washington, or were they your Middle Eastern neighbors in the region? Or were there mistakes on your part? Are there things you regret? And if you had the opportunity to go back, would you change them? In every state, there are mistakes, and mistakes might be made every day, but these mistakes do not constitute a crucial juncture because they are always there, so what is it that makes these mistakes suddenly lead to the situation we are living in Syria today? This doesn\u2019t make sense. You might be surprised if I tell that the crucial juncture in what happened in Syria is something that many people wouldn\u2019t even think about. It was the Iraq war in 2003, when the United States invaded Iraq. We were strongly opposed to that invasion, because we knew that things were moving in the direction of dividing societies and creating unrest. And we are Iraq\u2019s neighbors. At that time, we saw that the war will turn Iraq into a sectarian country, into a society divided against itself. To the West of Syria there is another sectarian country, Lebanon. We are in the middle. We knew well that we will be affected. Consequently, the beginning of the Syrian crisis, or what happened in the beginning, was the natural result of that war and the sectarian situation in Iraq, part of which moved to Syria, and it was easy for them to incite some Syrian groups on sectarian grounds. The second point which might be less crucial is that when the West adopted terrorism officially in Afghanistan in the early 1980s and called terrorists at that time \u201cfreedom fighters,\u201d and then in 2006 when the Islamic State appeared in Iraq under American sponsorship and they didn\u2019t fight it. All these things together created the conditions for the unrest with the Western support and Gulf money, particularly form Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and with Turkish logistic support, particularly that Erdogan belongs intellectually to the Muslim Brotherhood. Consequently, he believes that if the situation changed in Syria, Egypt, and Iraq, it means the creation of a new sultanate, this time not an Ottoman sultanate, but a sultanate for the Brotherhood extending from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean and ruled by Erdogan. All these factors together brought things to what we have today. Once again, I say that there were mistakes, and mistakes always create gaps and weak points, but they are not sufficient and they do not justify what happened. And if these gaps and weak points are the cause, why didn\u2019t they lead to revolutions in the Gulf States, particularly in Saudi Arabia which doesn\u2019t know anything about democracy? The answer is self-evident, I believe..Thank you"},

Dnes newspaper, Kmonicek said Turkey has been the main cross route of the back and forth movement of ISIS terrorist organization receiving funds and passing into Syria and moving stolen oil and historical artifacts out of Syria.Bridling the potentials and capabilities of ISIS, he said, would set bounds to the capabilities of the other groups of the so-called \u201copposition\u201d in Syria \u201cwhich in many cases are lacking clear orientations.\u201dIn a separate meeting, Hassan discussed with Jakub Kulhanek, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic for Security and Multilateral Affairs the political and humanitarian situation in Syria, counter-terrorism and bilateral relations.Kulhanek affirmed that the solution to the crisis in Syria comes through a Syrian-Syrian dialogue, calling for finding a permanent and comprehensive solution that restores peace and security to Syria.He pointed out that Czech is closely following Moscow consultations which aim to find a political solution for the crisis in Syria, hailing the role of the UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan De Mistura.Kulhanek said that Czech and Syria see eye to eye on that refugees are better helped in their own country and not in some other foreign one, pointing out that Czech is the only European country that has kept its diplomatic relation with Syria during the crisis which reflects its principled position towards the solution.For his part, Hassan affirmed that the fundamental solution to the refugees\u2019 problem in Europe lies in the unification of efforts to combat terrorism, stressing the need for a real Western intention to combat it through cooperation with the countries of the region, particularly Syria.Hassan said that sanctions imposed on Syria are contributing to the Syrians\u2019 displacement, urging Czech to call on its European partners to reconsider their sanctions against Syria and to exert pressure on countries that support terrorism, particularly Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan and some other western countries to halt their support.Haifa Said/Manar al-Frieh/Manal"},

{"date": "Syria: Humanitarian situation can\u2019t be improved without serious work to handle the main reason for the emergence of the crisis", "title": "29 January\u060c 2015", "text": "New York, SANA- Syria has stressed that the emergence of a humanitarian crisis in Syria and its aggravation was due to the terrorist acts perpetrated by the armed terrorist organizations.In a statement delivered before the UN Security Council on the situation in the Middle East, Syria underlined that the humanitarian situation can\u2019t be improved without serious work with the Syrian Government to handle the main reason for the emergence of the crisis in some areas which is represented in the crimes committed by the regionally and internationally-backed terrorist organizations.The statement made it clear that the Syrian Government has utilized all the national capacities starting from 2011 to provide the required needs of shelter, food and medicine to all citizens who have been affected by the crimes of the armed terrorist groups, affirming desire to continue cooperation with the United Nations to facilitate the delivery of aid to all affected civilians across Syria without any discrimination.It indicated that on Dec. 17, 2014, and after holding consultations and reaching an agreement with UN side, Syria has depended on the Syrian Response Plan for 2015 as a complementary of the national efforts exerted since the beginning of the crisis to alleviate the suffering of its citizens due to the terrorist acts and attacks and the negative repercussions of the attempts of the destructive foreign interference in Syria\u2019s internal affairs.The statement expressed regret that those who prepared the report of the Situation in the Middle East continue to follow a non-constructive approach towards the humanitarian situation in Syria as they are determined to politicize this file and to ignore the facts and developments on the ground.It stressed that without the efforts and cooperation of the Syrian Government with the specialized UN organizations and agencies, and the direct coordination between the two sides and without the protection provided to the UN personnel and convoys, the humanitarian and relief convoys wouldn\u2019t have been delivered in Dec. 2014, for example 3,6 million people have benefited from the medical aid inside the Syrian territories.The statement indicated that the humanitarian situation in Syrian couldn\u2019t be improved without giving priority and paying attention to the following data:-The serious work in coordination with the Syrian Government to handle the reason behind the emergence of the humanitarian crisis in some Syrian areas which is represented in the crimes committed by the armed terrorist organizations.-The policies of the General Secretariat should match with the UN Charter, the international legitimacy and the regulatory provisions of the humanitarian work in addition to the UN Security Council resolutions No. 2170/2014 and 2178/2014 which had approved the priority of countering terrorism and its organizations such as the \u201cISIS\u201d and \u201cJabhat al-Nusra\u201d and the affiliated organizations, and what is required today is to enhance cooperation and coordination with the Syrian Government in the domain of countering terrorism to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria through preventing some countries, particularly the Saudi Arabia and Turkey, from supporting and financing terrorism, in addition to drying up its financial resources and stopping the flow of foreign terrorists to Syria through borders in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions.-The UN should enhance its cooperation and coordination with the Syrian Government as an alternative of using the language of suspicions with regard to delivering aid to the affected people inside the Syrian territories according to the General Assembly\u2019s resolution No. 46/182.-Handling the problem of shortage in the funding which has been one of the main obstacles in implementing the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2014 as the percentage of financing it till Nov. 2014 didn\u2019t exceed 39% .-Canceling the unilateral and illegitimate coercive measures imposed on Syria by some countries which negatively and directly affected the living standards of the Syrian citizens and have reflected negatively on many vital sectors.-The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) should be obliged to provide detailed lists on the materials and aid which have entered through the borders to different areas in Syria and to show the bodies who are receiving them as all the information indicate that they are delivered to the terrorist groups.-The reports of the UN General Secretariat should be reliable and transparent when talking about the effectiveness of the mechanism of monitoring the process of aid entrance through the borders as the facts on the ground have proved that the UN doesn\u2019t have an effective mechanism that guarantees delivering aid to those who really deserve it in the areas where the armed terrorist organizations spread.-Turkey should stop using the unofficial border crossings to transport arms and criminal equipment to Syria and to allow terrorists to enter the country, and Saudi Arabia should stop using the border crossings used by OCHA to smuggle weapons and aid to Jabhat al-Nusra and other terrorist organizations as the UN should shoulder its moral and political responsibility to prevent that.-The UN personnel should stop making statements and reports including misleading and random estimations and inaccurate figures taken from unreliable sources on the humanitarian situation in Syria pushed by politicized reasons in a way that negatively affects the reliability, validity and accuracy of the humanitarian work.The statement clarified that the determination of those who prepared the report to continue to use the terms of \u201carmed opposition\u201d or \u201cnon-governmental armed groups\u201d or armed groups\u201d when talking about the armed terrorist organizations is disapproved and denounced as it contradicts the paragraph no. 10 of the report which indicated that the terrorist organizations of Ahrar al-Sham and Jaish al-Islam held an agreement with Jabhat al-Nusra organization which is listed in the terrorism list at the UN Security Council.The statement added that using the term \u201cnon-governmental armed groups\u201d by the UN General Secretariat to describe those who stole a vehicle of the UNDOF and exploded it in Daraa city is ridiculous, particularly as the UN Security Council had described those groups as terrorists, taking into consideration that these groups use the separation zone as a shelter and hotbed with a clear and divulged Israeli cover.It continued that it has become clear for all that in every time the armed terrorist groups fail to implement their terrorist crimes and each time terrorism is being defeated by the Syrian Arab Army, Israel seeks to play this role through repeated aggressions on the territories of the Syrian Arab Republic.The statement said that the number of civilian victims who have been injured or killed in various types of explosive shells fired by terrorists in 2014 till Jan. 2015 has been officially documented as 238 have been killed including 45 children while 377 have been injured including 82 children at the time when some are still determined to call them \u201cmoderate armed opposition\u201d in a desperate attempt to justify their interference in the Syrian internal affairs.The statement concluded by saying that the Syrian Government is still counts on an effective and responsible role to be played by the UN in dealing with the humanitarian situation in Syria and on supporting the resilience of the Syrians based on the respect of the Syrian sovereignty and the full cooperation with the Syrian Government in eliminating terrorism and delivering humanitarian and relief aid.R. al-Jazaeri / Ghossoun"},
{"date": "President al-Assad to Foreign Affairs Magazine: Israel is supporting terrorist organizations in Syria (Full Text)", "title": "27 January\u060c 2015", "text": "Damascus, SANA \u2013 President Bashar al-Assad gave an interview to the American magazine Foreign Affairs published on Monday.Following is the full text of the interview:Interview given by H.E. President Bashar al-Assad to Foreign Affairs MagazineQuestion 1: I would like to start by asking you about the war. It has now been going on for almost four years, and you know the statistics: more than two hundred thousand people have been killed, a million wounded, and more than three million Syrians have fled the country, according to the UN. Your forces have also suffered heavy casualties. The war cannot go on forever. How do you see the war ending?President Assad: All Wars, anywhere in the world have in the past ended with a political solution because war itself is not the solution; war is one of the instruments of politics. So you end with a political solution. That\u2019s how we see it. That is the headline.Question 2: You don\u2019t think that this war will end militarily?President Assad: No. Any war ends with a political solution.Question 3: Your country is increasingly divided into three mini-states, you could say: one is controlled by the government, one is controlled by ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, one is controlled by the more secular Sunni and Kurdish opposition. How will you ever put Syria back together again?President Assad: First of all, this image is not accurate because you cannot talk about mini-states with out talking about the people who live within those states. The Syrian people are still with the unity of Syria; they still support the government. The factions you refer to control some areas, but they move from one place to another; they are not stable, and there are no clear lines of separation between different forces. Sometimes they mingle with each other and they move. But the main issue is about the population. The population still supports the state regardless of whether they support it politically or not; I mean they support the state as the representative of the unity of Syria. This is what I mean by supporting the state. So as long as you have the Syrian people believing in unity, any government and any official can unify Syria. If the people are divided into two, three, or four groups, no one can unify this country. That\u2019s how we see it.Question 4: You think that the Sunnis and the Kurds still believe in a unified Syria?President Assad: If you go to Damascus now you can see all the different, let\u2019s say, colors of our society living together. So the divisions in Syria are not based on sectarian or ethnic grounds, and even in the Kurdish area you are talking about, we have two different colors; we have Arabs more than Kurds, so it\u2019s not about the ethnicity; it\u2019s about the factions that control certain areas militarily.Question 5: A year ago, both the opposition and foreign governments were insisting that you step down as a precondition to talks. They no longer are. Diplomats are now looking for an interim settlement that would allow you to keep a role. Just today, the New York Times had an article that talked about increased U.S. support for the Russian and UN peace initiatives. The article refers to: \u201cthe West\u2019s quiet retreat from its demands that Syria\u2019s president step down immediately.\u201d Given this shift in the Western attitude, are you now more open to a negotiated solution to the conflict that leads to a political transition?President Assad: From the very beginning we were open. We engaged in dialogue with every party in Syria. Party doesn\u2019t mean political party; it could be party, current, or some personality, it could be any political entity. We changed the constitution and we are open to anything. But when you want to do something, it\u2019s not about the position or about the government, it\u2019s about the Syrians; sometimes you might have a majority that doesn\u2019t belong to any side. So when you want to make a change, as long as you\u2019re talking about a national problem, every Syrian must have a say in it. When you have a dialogue, it\u2019s not between the government and the opposition; it\u2019s between the different Syrian parties and entities. That\u2019s how we look at dialogue. This is first. Second, whatever solution you want to make, at the end you should go back to the people through a referendum, because you\u2019re talking about the constitution; changing the political system, You have to go back to the Syrian people. So engaging in a dialogue is different from taking decisions, which is not done by the government or the opposition.Question 6: So you\u2019re saying that you would not agree to any kind of political transition unless there is a referendum that supports it?President Assad: Exactly, the people should make the decision, not anyone else.Question 7: Does that mean there\u2019s no room for negotiations?President Assad: No, we will go to Russia, we will go to these negotiations, but there is another question here: who do you negotiate with? As a government, we have institutions, we have an army, and we have influence, positive or negative, in any direction, at any time. Whereas the people we are going to negotiate with, who do they represent? That\u2019s the question. When you talk about the opposition, it has to have meaning. The opposition in general has to have representatives in the local administration, in the parliament, in institutions, they have to have grassroots to represent. In the current crisis, you have to ask about the opposition\u2019s influence on the ground. You have to go back to what the rebels announced publically, when they said many times that the opposition doesn\u2019t represent us, they have no influence. If you want to talk about fruitful dialogue, it\u2019s going to be between the government and those rebels. There is another point. Opposition means national, it means working for the interests of the Syrian people. It cannot be an opposition if it\u2019s a puppet of Qatar or Saudi Arabia or any Western country, including the United States, paid from the outside. It should be Syrian. We have a national opposition, I\u2019m not excluding it, I\u2019m not saying every opposition is not legitimate. But you have to separate the national and the puppets. Not every dialogue is fruitful.Question 8: Does that mean you would not want to meet with opposition forces that are backed by outside countries?President Assad: We are going to meet with everyone. We don\u2019t have conditions.Journalist: No conditions?President Assad: No conditions.Journalist: You would meet with everyone?President Assad: Yes, we\u2019re going to meet with everyone. But you have to ask each one of them: who do you represent? That\u2019s what I mean.Question 9: If I\u2019m correct, the deputy of UN representative Staffan de Mistura is in Syria now. They\u2019re proposing as an interim measure a ceasefire and a freeze in Aleppo. Would you agree to that?President Assad: Yes, of course. We implemented that before de Mistura was assigned to his mission. We implemented it in another city called Homs, another big city. We implemented it on smaller scales in different, let\u2019s say, suburbs, villages, and so on, and it succeeded. So, the idea is very good, but it depends on the details. De Mistura came to Syria with headlines. We agreed upon certain headlines, and now we are waiting for him to bring a detailed plan or schedule \u2013 A to Z plan \u2013 let\u2019s say. We are discussing this with his deputy.Question 10: In the past, you insisted as a precondition for a ceasefire that the rebels lay down their weapons first, which obviously from their perspective was a non-starter. Is that still your precondition?President Assad: We choose different scenarios or different reconciliations. In some areas, we allowed them to leave inhabited areas in order to prevent casualties among civilians. They left these areas with their armaments. In other areas, they give up their armaments and they left. It depends on what they offer and what you offer.Question 11: I\u2019m not clear on your answer. Would you insist that they lay down their weapons?President Assad: No, no. That\u2019s not what I mean. In some areas, they left the area with their armaments.Question 12: Are you optimistic about the Moscow talks?President Assad: What is going on in Moscow is not negotiations about the solution; it\u2019s only preparations for the conference.Journalist: So, talks about talks?President Assad: Exactly, how to prepare for the talks. So, when you start talking about the conference, what are the principles of the conference? I\u2019ll go back to the same point. Let me be frank: some of the groups are puppets, as I said, of other countries. They have to implement that agenda, and I know that many countries, like France for example, do not have any interest in making that conference succeed. So they will give them orders to make them fail. You have other personalities who only represent themselves, they don\u2019t represent anyone in Syria. Some of them never lived in Syria and they know nothing about the country. Of course, you have some other personalities who work for the national interest. So when you talk about the opposition as one entity, who\u2019s going to have influence on the other? That is the question. It\u2019s not clear yet. So, optimism would be an exaggeration. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m pessimistic, I would say we have hope, in every action.Question 13: It seems that in recent days the Americans have become more supportive of the Moscow talks. Initially, they were not. Yesterday, Secretary of State Kerry said something to suggest that the U.S. hopes that the talks go forward and that they are successful.President Assad: They always say things, but it\u2019s about what they\u2019re going to do. And you know there\u2019s mistrust between the Syrians and the U.S. So just wait till we see what will happen at the conference.Question 14: So, what do you see as the best way to strike a deal between all of the different parties in Syria?President Assad: It\u2019s to deal directly with the rebels, but you have two different kinds of rebels. Now, the majority are al Qaeda, which is ISIS and al-Nusra, with other similar factions that belong to al Qaeda but are smaller. Now, what\u2019s left, what Obama called a \u201cfantasy\u201d the moderate opposition. It\u2019s not an opposition, they are rebels. Most of them joined al Qaeda, and some of them rejoined the army recently. During the last week, a lot of them left those groups and came to the army.Question 15: Are these former defectors who came back?President Assad: Yes, they came back to the army. They said, we don\u2019t want to fight anymore. So what\u2019s left of those is very little. At the end, can you negotiate with al Qaeda, and others? They are not ready to negotiate, they have their own plan. The reconciliation that we started and Mr. de Mistura is going to continue is the practical solution on the ground. This is the first point. Second, you have to implement the Security Council resolution No. 2170 on al-Nusra and ISIS which was issued a few months ago, and this resolution is very clear about preventing anyone from supporting these factions militarily, financially, or logistically, yet this is what Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are still doing. If it\u2019s not implemented, we cannot talk about a real solution because there will be obstacles. So this is how we can start. Third, the Western countries should remove the umbrella, still refered to by some of supporting the moderate opposition. They know we have mainly al Qaeda, ISIS and al Nusra.Question 16: Would you be prepared to take any confidence-building measures in advance of the talks? For example, prisoner exchanges, or ending the use of barrel bombs, or releasing political prisoners, in order to build confidence on the other side that you\u2019re willing to negotiate in good faith?President Assad: It\u2019s not a personal relationship; it\u2019s about mechanisms. In politics, you only talk about mechanisms. You don\u2019t have to trust someone to do something. If you have a clear mechanism, you can reach a result. That is what the people want. So the question is, what is the mechanism that we can put in place? This takes us back to the same question: who are they, what do they represent, what\u2019s their influence, what is the point of building trust with people with no influence?Journalist: When two parties come together, it\u2019s often very useful for one party to show the other that it\u2019s really interested in making progress by taking steps unilaterally to try and bring down the temperature. The measures that I described would have that effect.President Assad: You have something concrete, and that is reconciliation. People gave up their armaments, we gave them amnesty, they live normal lives. It is a real example. So this is a measure of confidence. On the other hand, what is the relation between that opposition and the prisoners? There\u2019s no relation. They are not their prisoners anyway. So it is completely a different issue.Question 17: So, have you offered amnesty to fighters?President Assad: Yes, of course, and we did it many times.Question 18: How many, do you have numbers?President Assad: I don\u2019t have the precise numbers, but it\u2019s thousands, not hundreds, thousands of militants.Question 19: And are you prepared to say to the entire opposition that if you lay down your weapons, you will be safe?President Assad: Yes, I said it publically in one of my speeches.Question 20: And how can you guarantee their safety? Because they have reasons to distrust your government.President Assad: You cannot, but at the end, let\u2019s say that if more than 50 percent succeed, more than 50 percent in such circumstances would be a success. So, that\u2019s how. Nothing is absolute. You have to expect some negative aspects, but they are not the major aspects.Question 21: Let me change the subject slightly. Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Quds force and Iranian-trained Shiite militias are all now playing significant roles in the fight against rebels here in Syria. Given this involvement, are you worried about Iran\u2019s influence over the country? After all, Iraq or even Lebanon shows that once a foreign military power becomes established in a country, it can be very difficult to ask them to leave again.President Assad: Iran is an important country in this region, and it was influential before the crisis. It\u2019s influence is not related to the crisis, it\u2019s related to its role, its political position in general. When you talk about influence, various factors make a particular country influential. In the Middle East, in our region, you have the same society, the same ideology, many similar things, the same tribes, going across borders. So those factors are crossing the borders. If you have influence on one factor, your influence will be crossing the border. This is part of our nature. It\u2019s not related to the conflict. Of course, when there is conflict and anarchy, another country will be more influential in your country. When you don\u2019t have the will to have a sovereign country, you will have that influence. Now, the answer to your question is, Iran doesn\u2019t have any ambitions in Syria, and as a country, as Syria, we would never allow any country to have influence our sovereignty. We don\u2019t accept and the Iranians don\u2019t want it either. We allow cooperation. But if you allowed any country to have influence, why not allow the Americans to have influence in Syria? That\u2019s the problem with the Americans and with the West: they want to have influence without cooperation.Question 22: Let me just push you a little bit further. Last week, a commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, of their airspace command, Haji Zadeh, said in an interview that Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader has ordered his forces to build and operate missile plants in Syria. That suggests that Iran is playing a greater role and doing it on its own.President Assad: No, playing a role through cooperation is different from playing a role through hegemony.Question 23: So everything that Iran is doing\u2026?President Assad: Of course, in full cooperation with the Syrian government, and that\u2019s always the case.Question 24: Now Iran is one thing to deal with because it\u2019s a country. But you also have militias which are sub-state actors, and therefore more complicated. One problem with working with these groups is that, unlike a government, they may not be willing to cooperate and it\u2019s not always clear who to talk to. Are you worried about your ability to control these forces and to rein them in if you need to? And, a related question, this week Israel attacked Hezbollah forces in the Golan, and the Israelis suggest that they attacked them because Hezbollah was planning an attack on Israel from Syrian territory. Doesn\u2019t this also highlight the danger of allowing militias with their own agendas, not necessarily your agenda, to come into the war?President Assad: Do you mean Syrian, or any other militias in general?Journalist: I mean especially Hezbollah and the Iraqi Shi\u2019a militias.President Assad: It\u2019s natural to say that only the institutions of the government, of the state, let\u2019s say, are the guarantee for stability and order. Any other factor that would play a role in parallel with the government could be positive, could be good in certain circumstances, but it will always have side effects, negative side effects. That is a natural thing. And having militias who support the government is a side effect of the war. You have it, but you\u2019re going to try to control this side effect. So, to have the way, if you ask any Syrian about that, he will give you a similar answer. Nobody will feel more comfortable than if they are dealing with government institutions, including the army and the police and so on. But talking about what happened in Quneitra is something completely different. Never has an operation against Israel happened through the Golan Heights since the ceasefire in 1974. It has never happened. So, for Israel to allege that there was a plan for an operation, that\u2019s a far cry from reality, just an excuse, because they wanted to assassinate somebody from Hezbollah.Question 25: But the Israelis have been very careful since the war began to not get involved except when they felt when their interests were directly threatened.President Assad: That\u2019s not true, because they\u2019ve been attacking Syria now for nearly two years, without any reason.Journalist: But in each case, they say it\u2019s because Hezbollah was being given weapons from Iran through Syria.President Assad: They attacked army positions. What is the relation between Hezbollah and the army?Journalist: Those were cases where the army accidentally shelled-President Assad: Those are false allegations.Question 26: So what do you think Israel\u2019s agenda is?President Assad: They are supporting the rebels in Syria. It\u2019s very clear. Because whenever we make advances in some place, they attack in order to undermine the army. It\u2019s very clear. That\u2019s why some in Syria joke, how can you say that al Qaeda doesn\u2019t have an air force? They have the Israeli air force.Question 27: To return to my question about militias, do you feel confident that you\u2019ll be able to control them when this war end, because after all, any government, to have effective sovereignty, has to have what\u2019s called a monopoly of force, and that\u2019s very hard when you have these independent armed groups running around.President Assad: That\u2019s self-evident, the state cannot fulfill its commitment to society if it\u2019s not the only master of order.Journalist: But you see in Iraq how hard that is, because it is now very difficult for the government to control all these Shia militia which were empowered during the war.President Assad: There\u2019s a very important reason in Iraq: it\u2019s because Paul Bremmer didn\u2019t create a constitution for the state; he created one for factions. Whereas in Syria why did the army stand fast for four years in spite of this embargo, this war, tens of countries around the world attacking Syria and supporting the rebels? Because it has a real constitution, a real, secular constitution. That is the reason. In Iraq, it is sectarian. When you talk about a sectarian constitution, it\u2019s not a constitution.Question 28: But what will you do about these militias when the war ends?President Assad: Things should go back to normal like before the war.Question 29: And you\u2019re confident-?President Assad: Yes, we don\u2019t have any other option. That is the role of the government. This is self-evident.Question 30: What impact are falling oil prices having on the war in Syria? After all, your two closest allies and supporters, Iran and Russia, are very dependent on oil prices and they have suffered tremendous damage to their budgets in recent months as the price of oil has fallen. Do you worry about their ability to continue helping you?President Assad: No, because they don\u2019t give us money, so it has no effect on Syria. Even if they are going to help us, it would be in the forms of loans We\u2019re like any other country, Sometimes we pay, sometimes we take loans.Journalist: But their military support costs them money, and if they have less money to pay for their own militaries, won\u2019t that become a problem?President Assad: No, because when you pay for armaments or any other goods, you don\u2019t have a problem.Question 31: So you\u2019re saying everything you\u2019re getting from the Russians and Iranians\u2026?President Assad: So far we haven\u2019t seen any changes, so what the influence is on them, I cannot answer.Question 32: You\u2019ve said in past interviews that you and your government have made mistakes in the course of the war. What are those mistakes? Is there anything that you regret?President Assad: Every government, every person, makes mistakes, so that\u2019s again self-evident, it\u2019s a given. But if you want to talk about political mistakes, you have to ask yourself, what are the major decisions that you took since the crisis started? We took three main decisions: first of all, to be open to all dialogue. Second, we changed the constitution and the law according to what many in the opposition were saying, allegedly, that this is the reason of the crisis. Third, we took the decision to defend our country, to defend our self, to fight terrorists. So I don\u2019t think those three decisions can be described as wrong or mistakes. If you want to talk about practice, any official in any place can make mistakes, but there\u2019s a difference between practice mistakes and policy mistakes.Question 33: Can you describe some of the practical mistakes?President Assad: I would have to go back to officials on the ground, there\u2019s nothing in my mind. I would rather talk about policies.Question 34: Do you feel there have been any policy mistakes that you\u2019re responsible for?President Assad: I mentioned the major decisions.Journalist: But you said those are not mistakes.President Assad: To defend the country from terrorism? If I wanted to say that it\u2019s a mistake, then to be correct would be to support the terrorists.Journalist: I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything you did that you wish in retrospect you had done differently.President Assad: Regarding these three main decisions, they were correct, and I am confident about this.Question 35: In terms of lower-level practical mistakes, are people being held accountable, say, for human rights abuses, for the excessive use of force, or the indiscriminate targeting of civilians, those kinds of things?President Assad: Yes. Some people were detained because they breached the law in that regard, and that happens of course in such circumstances.Journalist: In terms of their treatment of civilians or protestors, is that what you\u2019re referring to?President Assad: Yes, during the protests at the very beginning, yes.Question 36: Since the U.S. began its air campaign against the Islamic State, Syria and the U.S. have become strange kinds of partners and are effectively cooperating in that aspect of the fight. Do you see the potential for increased cooperation with the U.S.?President Assad: The potential is definitely always there, because we\u2019ve been talking about or asking for international cooperation against terrorism for 30 years, but this potential needs will. The question that we have is, how much will does the United States have to really fight terrorism on the ground? So far, we haven\u2019t seen anything concrete in spite of the attacks on ISIS in northern Syria. There\u2019s nothing concrete. What we\u2019ve seen so far is just, let\u2019s say, window dressing, nothing real. Since the beginning of these attacks, ISIS has gained more land in Syria and Iraq.Question 37: What about the airstrikes on Kobani? Those have been effective in slowing ISIS.President Assad: Kobani is a small city, with about 50,000 inhabitants. It\u2019s been more than three months since the beginning of the attacks, and they haven\u2019t finished. The Same areas, With the al Qaeda factions occupying them, the Syrian Army liberated in less than three weeks. It means they\u2019re not serious about fighting terrorism.Question 38: So are you saying you want a greater U.S. involvement in the war against ISIS?President Assad: It\u2019s not about greater involvement by the military, because it\u2019s not only about the military, it\u2019s about politics, it\u2019s about how much the United States wants to influence the Turks, because if the terrorists can withstand the airstrikes for this period, it means that the Turks keep sending them armaments and money. Did the United States put any pressure on Turkey to stop the support of al Qaeda? They didn\u2019t, they haven\u2019t. So, it\u2019s not only about military involvement. This is first. Second, if you want to talk about the military involvement, American officials publically acknowledge that without troops on the ground, they cannot achieve anything concrete. Which troops on the grounds are you depending on?Question 39: So are you suggesting there should be U.S. troops on the ground?President Assad: Not U.S. troops. I\u2019m talking about the principle, the military principle, I\u2019m not saying American troops. If you want to say I want to make war on terrorism, you have to have troops on the ground. The question you have to ask the Americans is: which troops are you going to depend on? Definitely, it has to be Syrian troops. This is our land, this is our country. We are responsible. We don\u2019t ask for American troops at all.Question 40: So, what would you like to see from the United States? You mentioned more pressure on Turkey \u2026President Assad: Pressure on Turkey, pressure on Saudi Arabia, pressure on Qatar to stop supporting the rebels. Second, to make legal cooperation with Syria and start by asking permission from our government to carry out such attacks. They didn\u2019t, so it\u2019s illegal.Question 41: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not clear on that point. You want them to make legal\u2026?President Assad: Of course, if you want to make any kind of action in another country, you ask their permission.Question 42: I see. So, a formal agreement between Washington and Damascus to allow for airstrikes?President Assad: The format we can discuss later, but you start with permission. Is it an agreement, is it a treaty? That\u2019s another issue.Question 43: And would you be willing to take steps to make cooperation easier with Washington?President Assad: With any country that is serious about fighting terrorism, we are ready to make cooperation, if they\u2019re serious.Question 44: What steps would you be prepared to make to show Washington that you\u2019re willing to cooperate?President Assad: I think they are the ones who have to show the will. We are already fighting on the ground, we don\u2019t have to show that.Question 45: The U.S. is currently training 5,000 Syrian fighters who are scheduled to enter Syria in May. Now, U.S. General John Allen has been very careful to say that these troops will not be directed at the Syrian government, but will be focused on ISIS alone. What will you do when these troops enter the country? Will you allow them to enter? Will you attack them?President Assad: Any troops that don\u2019t work in cooperation with the Syrian Army are illegal and should be fought. That\u2019s very clear.Question 46: Even if this brings you into conflict with the U.S.?President Assad: Without cooperation with Syrian troops, they are illegal, and are puppets of another country, so they are going to be fought like any other illegal militia fighting against the Syrian Army. But that brings another question, about those troops. Obama said that they are a fantasy. How did fantasy become reality?Journalist: I think with kind of training program.President Assad: But you can\u2019t make extremism moderate.Journalist: There are still some moderate members of the opposition. They are weaker and weaker all the time, but I think the U.S. government is trying very carefully to ensure that the fighters it trains are not radicals.President Assad: But the question is why is the moderate opposition \u2013 if you call them opposition, we call them rebels \u2013 why are they weaker and weaker? They are still weaker because of developments in the Syrian crisis. Bringing 5,000 from the outside will make most of them defect and join ISIS and other groups which is what happened during the last year. So that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s still illusory. It is not the 5,000 that are illusory, but the idea itself.Question 47: Part of what makes Washington so reluctant to cooperate with you more formally are the allegations of serious human rights abuses by your government. These allegations aren\u2019t just from the U.S. government, they are also from the UN Human Rights Commission, the Independent Special Investigative Commission of the UN. You are familiar with these allegations, I\u2019m sure. They include denying access for relief groups to refugee camps, indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets, photo evidence provided by the defector code-named Cesar who made a presentation to the U.S. Congress showing terrible torture and abuse in Syrian prisons. Are you prepared to take action on these issues in order to make cooperation with the U.S. easier?President Assad: The funny thing about this administration is that it\u2019s the first one in history to build its evaluation and later decisions on social media. We call it a social media administration, which is not politics. None of these allegations you mentioned are concrete, all of them are allegations. You can bring photos from anyone and say this is torture. Who took the pictures? Who is he? Nobody knows. There is no verification of any of this evidence, so it\u2019s all allegations without evidence.Journalist: But Cesar\u2019s photos have been looked at by independent European investigators.President Assad: No, no. It\u2019s funded by Qatar, and they say it\u2019s an anonymous source. So nothing is clear or proven. The pictures are not clear which person they show. They\u2019re just pictures of a head, for example, with some skulls. Who said this is done by the government, not by the rebels? Who said this is a Syrian victim, not someone else? For example, photos published at the beginning of the crisis were from Iraq and Yemen. Second, the United States in particular and the West in general are in no position to talk about human rights. They are responsible for most of the killings in the region, especially the United States after getting into Iraq, and the UK after invading Libya, and the situation in Yemen, and what happened in Egypt in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and terrorism in Tunisia. All these problems happened because of the United States. They were the first ones to trample international law and Security Council resolutions, not us.Journalist: That may or may not be true, but those are separate issues, and that does not absolve your government of responsibility.President Assad: No, no. The United States accused, so we have to answer that part. I\u2019m not saying if there\u2019s any human rights breach or infringement, the government has no responsibility. That is another issue. The second part of your question is about the allegations, they\u2019re still allegations. If you want me to answer, I have to answer about something that is concrete, proved, and verified.Question 48: Are you prepared to categorically deny that there\u2019s torture and abuse of prisoners in Syria?President Assad: If there\u2019s any unbiased and fair way to verify all those allegations, of course we are ready. That would be in our interest.Question 49: What impact would a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal have on Syria?President Assad: Nothing, because the crisis here was never part of the negotiations, and Iran refused to make it such, and that is correct because there is no link between the two.Journalist: But many in the U.S. anticipate that if Iran and the U.S. strike a deal, it will make cooperation between the two countries much easier. People therefore wonder if Iran might decide to reduce its support for Syria as a favor to the U.S. government.President Assad: We have never had any positive information about such a thing, never. I cannot discuss something which I don\u2019t have any information about.Question 50: Describe whether you think the war is going well from the government\u2019s perspective. Independent analysts have suggested that your government currently controls 45 to 50 percent of the territory of Syria.President Assad: First of all, if you want to describe the arena, it\u2019s not a war between two countries, between two armies where you have an incursion and you lost some territory that you want to regain. It\u2019s not like this. We\u2019re talking about rebels that infiltrate areas inhabited by civilians. You have Syrian terrorists that support foreign terrorists to come and hide among civilians, they launch what you call guerrilla attacks. That is the shape of this war, so you cannot look at it as being about territory. Second, wherever the Syrian Army has wanted to go, it has succeeded, but the Syrian army cannot have a presence on every kilometer of Syrian territory. That\u2019s impossible. We made some advances in the past two years. But if you want to ask me \u201cis it going well,\u201d I say that every war is bad, because you always lose, you always have destruction in a war. The main question is what have we won in this war? What we won in this war is that the Syrian people have rejected the terrorists, the Syrian people support their government more, the Syrian people support their army more. Before talking about winning territory, talk about winning the hearts and minds and the support of the Syrian people. That\u2019s what we have won. What\u2019s left is logistical, it\u2019s technical. That is a matter of time. The war is moving in a positive way, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not losing on the national level, because you lose lives, you lose infrastructure, the war itself has very bad social effects.Question 51: Do you think you will eventually defeat the rebels militarily?President Assad: If they don\u2019t have external support, and supply and recruitment of new terrorists within Syria, there will be no problem defeating them. Even today we don\u2019t have a problem militarily. The problem is that they still have this continuous supply, mainly from Turkey.Question 52: So, Turkey seems to be the neighbor that you\u2019re most concerned about?President Assad: Exactly, logistically, and about terrorist financing from Saudi Arabia and Qatar but through Turkey.Question 53: Do you blame Erdogan personally? This is a man you once had a fairly good relationship with.President Assad: Exactly, because he belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood ideology, which is the base of al Qaeda because it was the first political Islamic organization that promoted violent political Islam in the early 20th century. He belongs strongly and is a staunch believer in these values, he\u2019s very fanatical, and that\u2019s why he still supports ISIS. He is personally responsible for what happened.Question 54: Do you see any other potential partners in the region? For example, General al-Sisi in Egypt?President Assad: I wouldn\u2019t talk about him personally, but as long as Egypt and the Egyptian army and the government are fighting the same kind of terrorists as in Iraq, of course, we can consider these countries eligible to cooperate with in fighting the same enemy.Question 55: Two final questions, if I may. Can you imagine a scenario in which Syria returns to the status quo as it was before the fighting started almost four years ago?President Assad: In what sense?Journalist: In the sense that Syria is whole again, it is not divided, it controls its borders, it starts to rebuild, and it is at peace and a predominantly secular country.President Assad: If you look at a military map now, the Syrian Army exists in every corner. Not every place; by every corner I mean north, south, east, west, and between. If you didn\u2019t believe in a unified Syria, that Syria can go back to its previous position, you wouldn\u2019t send the army there, as a government. If you don\u2019t believe in this as a people, you would have seen people in Syria isolated in different ghettos, people isolated in different ghettos based on ethnic and sectarian or religious identity. As long as this is not the situation, the people live with each other, the army is everywhere, the army is made up of every color of Syrian society, or the Syrian fabric. This means that we all believe Syria should go back to the way it was. We don\u2019t have any other option, because if it doesn\u2019t go back to its previous position, that will affect every surrounding country. It\u2019s one fabric, it\u2019s a domino effect that will have influence from the Atlantic to the Pacific.Question 56: If you were able to deliver a message to President Obama today, what would it be?President Assad: I think the normal thing that you ask any official in the world is to work for the interests of his people. And the question I would ask any American is: what do you get from supporting terrorists in our country, in our region? What did you get from supporting the Muslim Brotherhood a few years ago in Egypt and other countries? What did you get from supporting someone like Erdogan? One of the officials from your country asked me seven years ago in Syria at the end of a meeting: how do you think we can solve the problem in Afghanistan? I told him, you have to be able to deal with officials who are not puppets, who can tell you \u201cno.\u201d So, for the United States only looking for puppet officials and client states is not how you can serve the interests of your country. You are the greatest power in the world now, you have many things to disseminate around the world: knowledge, innovation, IT with its positive repercussions. How can you be the best in these fields yet the worst in the political field? This is a contradiction. That is what I think the American people should analyze and question. Why do you fail in every war? You can create war, you can create problems, but you cannot solve any problem. Twenty years of the peace process in Palestine and Israel and you cannot do anything with this in spite of the fact that you are a great country.Question 57: But in the context of Syria, what would a better policy look like?President Assad: One that preserves stability in the Middle East. Syria is the heart of the Middle East. Everybody knows that. If the Middle East is sick, the whole world will be unstable. In 1991, when we started the peace process, we had a lot of hope. Now, after over 20 years, things are not at square one; they\u2019re much below that square. So the policy should be to help peace in the region, to fight terrorism, to promote secularism, to support this area economically, to help upgrade the mind and society like you did in your country.

The talks stalled and didn\u2019t reach an agreement on a political solution to the crisis in the country, with the Coalition delegation of the so-called opposition refusing to accept to acknowledge that combating terrorism is the top priority, something which was proposed by the government\u2019s delegation.Lavrov said at the conference that what is needed is holding dialogue in a calm atmosphere with all sides being represented in order to reach a political solution, noting that the opposition members will have the chance to hold talks in a neutral place without any representation of other states.It is important, Lavrov said, that the opposition figures understand that they have to live in Syria as a sovereign state with territorial integrity where all its social components are protected, and afterwards, they could meet unofficially with the government representatives, noting that if any new political equation could be reached, that would help the UN Special Envy for Syria Staffan de Mistura find a new formula for the process.\u201cThere is full conviction in the West that a political solution to the crisis in Syria is inevitable,\u201d Lavrov said, pointing out that the priority today is for fighting terrorism and combating ISIS, noting that Russia stressed the importance of eliminating terrorism a long time ago.The Russian Foreign Minister reiterated that counterterrorism is vital for overcoming the crisis in Syria, pointing out that bombarding any sites of a sovereign state under the pretext of eliminating terrorist groups without the approval of the concerned states and the Security Council is illegal.He added that counterterrorism should be implemented in accordance with international law, as the Security Council is the only body allowed to designate any group as a terrorist group.Lavrov said that the discourse of some western powers who claim that cooperation with the Syrian government for counterterrorism is impossible is void; citing the example of the dismantling of chemical weapons which took place through cooperation with the Syrian government.Rasha Milhem / Haifa Said / Hazem Sabbagh"},

OCHA is also supposed to notify the Syrian government of the content and destination of the aid.\u201cThis is the reason behind the agreement of all sides with the Syrian government on what is called monitoring mechanism of assistance crossing borders\u2026 and we even have the right to agree on the nationality of the workers, but of course Under Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos did not respect this agreement since the first hours of signing it\u201d he added.Syria\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN expressed Syria\u2019s hope that those who submitted the resolution 2191 discussed with the Syrian government the reasons led to the inefficiency of the UN procedures to improve the humanitarian situation in Syria, particularly those which were included in the UN Resolution No.2165.He elaborated that the main reasons for the UN failure are: denying that terrorism , backed by some known countries, was the main reason for the eruption of the humanitarian crisis in many areas across Syria as well as OCHA\u2019s non-cooperation with the Syrian government and its insistence to deliver the aid across the border without a precedent coordination with Syria and engaging Syrian Arab Red Crescent ( SARC) in the process which caused fall of humanitarian aid in the hands of armed terrorist organizations, he continued.The lack of finance is also one of the main obstacles facing the implementation of the Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan for 2014 (SHARP) as the volume of finance that has been ensured didn\u2019t exceed more than 39 per cent, al-Jaafari said.\nImposing unilateral, coercive and illegal measures by some countries which alleged their friendship to the Syrian people has directly affected the living situation of the Syrian people, government and private sector\u2019s ability to ensure their needs, al-Jaafari added.He criticized the irresponsible and criminal acts perpetrated by some member-states, mainly the EU recent decision to stop fuel supply to Syrian civil plans describing it as \u201ca violation of the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Canada\u201d.Answering journalist questions, al-Jaafari said .. Jordanian, Luxemburg and Australian ambassadors have presented a misleading and baseless draft resolution which proves their carelessness towards the issue of delivering humanitarian aid to Syrians.Al-Jaafari stressed that everyone is called to understand the reality of what is going on in Syria as this resolution aims at delivering humanitarian aid to those who are in need in Syria, but not to topple Syrian government.He went on saying that despite of all briefs presented by Amos to the Council she wasn\u2019t able to deliver more than 5 per cent of humanitarian aid across the borders ,that is because the plan was \u201cillogical and impractical and tried to avoid cooperation and coordination with the Syrian government for certain political goals.\u201d\u201cIn some cases UN employees left humanitarian aid convoys, which were only 239 trucks, in areas under control of Jabhat al-Nusra, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ISIS or other terrorist organizations.On a question over Resolution 2165 and non mentioning local parties in it and no hints of US and its allies air campaign, and the stance of the Syrian government towards the impact of this issue on killing civilians and hindering delivery of humanitarian aid, al-Jaafari said .. we informed OCHA, UN Secretary General and a number of the Council\u2019s members when Israel recently breached Disengagement of Forces Agreement 1974 by targeting some areas in Damascus, asserting that Syria called for enrolling this issue but they didn\u2019t respond as they seek to violate Syrian sovereignty as Israel did, accusing some UN members of deeply sharing Israeli misleading campaign against Syria.On a question of the impact of the so-called the \u201cfreeze zones\u201d on the humanitarian aid, al-Jaafari said De Minstura\u2019s track is completely different as it is a political track, adding that the preliminary articles of the resolution didn\u2019t include any hint of UN Resolution no. 2170 and 2178 nor to De Mistura\u2019s mission, but it was referred to recently.R.

evening adopted resolution no. 2170 on preventing the supporting, funding, and arming of the terrorists of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Jabhat al-Nusra and preventing the flow of terrorists to Syria and Iraq.The Council urged all UN member countries to take steps to prevent the flow of terrorists and bringing them to justice, in addition to address the issue of individuals who may be at risk of being recruited in order to prevent them from traveling to Syria and Iraq.The resolution prohibits the direct or indirect sale of weapons and related items to ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra, and individuals associated with them, listing six individuals affiliated with terrorist groups on the list of sanctions that affect Al Qaeda, asserting readiness to consider listing individuals, groups, establishments, and entities that support the two aforementioned organizations in the list, and this covers those who fund, arm, plan, recruit, and who are members in them through information technology.The six individuals in question are Abdulrahman al-Zafer al-Dabidi al-Jahani, Hajjaj Bin Fahed al-Ajami, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, Saeed Arif, Abdulmohsen Abdullah Ibrahim al-Sharekh, and Hamed Hamad Hamed al-Ali.The Council voiced concern over the impact of the violent ideology and extremist acts of these two organizations on locals and on their role in causing sectarian tension, noting that ISIS members have been carrying out lethal attacks in Iraq and Syria during the past two weeks.The Council denounced the terrorist acts of ISIS, describing it as a splinter group from Al Qaeda, in addition to voicing concern over the fact that the oil fields and associated infrastructure being controlled by ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra provide them with income, which supports their recruitment efforts and ability to carry out terrorist attacks.The resolution stipulates that freezing assets, prohibiting travel, and weapons embargo apply to ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra members and all individuals, groups, establishments, and entities associated with Al Qaeda.The Council instructed the team in charge of monitoring breaches in the sanctions on terrorist groups to report within 90 days on threats in areas where ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra are active and provide recommendations to deal with this threat.In a statement during the Security Council session, Syria\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN, Dr. Bashar al-Jaafari, said that this resolution is important and hotly-anticipated, particularly by Syria, due to the growing threat represented by ISI, Jabhat al-Nusra, and Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist organizations which adopt violent and extremist ideals.Al-Jaafari said that Syria had been fighting a grueling war against takfiri terrorist groups single-handedly on behalf of humanity, with the Syrian government making painstaking efforts to draw the UN members\u2019 attention to the threat these organizations pose.He pointed out that a number of influential countries in the Arab, regional, and international arenas exerted great efforts to cover up the truth of what is happening in Syria, and these countries continued to support, arm, harbor, fund, and provide media cover for terrorist groups, trying to pass them off either as moderate armed opposition or jihadist opposition.Al-Jaafari noted that the Syrian government sent the Security Council and other UN bodies hundreds of letters, documents, pictures, videos, and names related to the crimes committed by terrorist groups like ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra, the Islamic Front, and others, showing the horrifying acts of murder, torture, and terrorizing committed by these groups against innocent Syrian civilians, as well as the genocide-like attacks on certain parts of the Syrian and Iraqi societies, their methodical vandalism of infrastructure in Syria, and their theft and smuggling of petroleum which is sold abroad via Turkish and European brokers.Syria\u2019s Representative demanded to know who is buying Syrian petroleum from ISIS, and how this stolen petroleum is reaching Europe from Turkey, and how come Security Council members failed to address Syria\u2019s constant complaints that were filed throughout the past three years on the exportation of weapons and terrorists from Libya to Syria via Turkey and Lebanon.He said that all documents sent by Syria regarding this issue have been ignored deliberately, and that had they been considered and had the Security Council counterterrorism resolutions been applied, then the situation would not have reached the point it is at today.Al-Jaafari hoped that the new resolution will be implemented optimally without discrimination or selectiveness, and that it will not infringe upon the relevant countries\u2019 sovereignty, territorial integrity, or independence.He asserted that counterterrorism is a priority for the Syrian government, which had often demanded that the Security Council take its concerns regarding this issue into considerations, urging the Council to hold dialogue among relevant and concerned countries before adopting such resolutions in the future.Syria\u2019s representatives said the Security Council must call on the countries that adopt and support extremist ideologies to issue official statements denouncing takfiri mentality, adding that the resolution should have referenced the destructive role played by channels broadcasting from Arab Gulf and Western countries and by takfiri websites, and that these channels and sites should be dealt with.In a press conference following the session, al-Jaafari pointed out that the West\u2019s considerations have shifted because its own security is at risk, as opposed to when terrorists were only killing Syrians, at which point the Western capitals were promoting them as proponents of freedom and democracy or as moderate opposition.\u201cWhen those terrorists began returning to their capitals, and when social media began revealing their reprehensible crimes, the West awoke to this tragedy,\u201d he said, noting that Syria requested that the Islamic Front be listed among terrorism-sponsoring entities, but Western countries continue to refuse that, despite that this organizations commits heinous crimes like ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra.Al-Jaafari said the new resolution is positive, even if it came too late, and that it also overlooks Israel\u2019s role in smuggling terrorists from Jordan to the disengagement zone in the occupied Syrian Golan, from which they enter Syria to commit their crimes, adding that the resolution also overlooks the role of Saudi Arabia and Turkey in supporting, arming, funding, and sending terrorists to Syria.He said that the resolution mainly seeks to justify the West\u2019s behavior and policies in the region, with them claiming to fight terrorism when they actually don\u2019t want a resolution that really combats terrorism; rather they want absolution from terrorism and to be seen as being against ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra.Al-Jaafari also criticized the British representative who was chairing the meeting and who interrupted him and Iraq\u2019s representative during their statements because \u201che sensed that we were going to say things that he doesn\u2019t want the Western and Arab public opinion to hear.\u201dHazem Sabbagh"},

Palestinian people whose main concern is to defend their children, honor and rights.\u201dMikdad\u2019s remarks came in a speech delivered Monday during the Ministerial meeting of Palestine Committee affiliated to Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).He criticized the stance of the United Nations \u201cUN\u201d which keeps silent towards what is taking place in Palestine.Mikdad said that Israel has been killing the Palestinians and destroying their houses, in addition to shelling the schools of the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) while the UN keeps silent in a time when its officials defend other issues which they think that they come in line with the UN Charter.Mikdad indicated that the reason behind the ongoing massacres committed by Israel against the Palestinian people in Gaza is not the accident of the three settlers, as the Israeli leaders don\u2019t want to see a Palestinian child alive and Israel doesn\u2019t consider the Palestinians as humans and it doesn\u2019t want them to live.He indicated that Israel doesn\u2019t want peace, but it wants the land of Arabs and peace together , and it wants to impose its hegemony on the region to put its people in service of the Zionist and Western goals.Mikdad affirmed Syria\u2019s stance in support of the Palestinian cause which is the main cause of the Syrian people as Syria has built its economy, policy and stances on what it believes that would serve its central cause, namely the Palestinian cause.He appreciated South American countries\u2019 leaders who recalled their ambassadors from Israel in protest against the inhuman Israeli aggression on Gaza, whishing that all the countries will take the same measures.Mikdad called for prosecuting the Israeli officials before the

of Syria\u2019s delegation headed by Deputy Foreign and Expatriates Minister Fayssal Mikdad.The statement stressed that the Israeli aggression on Gaza led to the killing and injuring of thousands of innocent Palestinians in Gaza, and that it constitutes a violation of human rights, calling for an immediate and unconditional cessation of this aggression and for lifting the siege imposed on Gaza which also constitutes a violation of human rights.The participants called for opening all border crossing points with Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid, medical teams, and relief, calling on

responsibilities as per the UN Charter and deal with the situation in occupied Palestine which poses a threat to stability and security in the region and the world, calling on the Council to pressure Israel to cease its aggression and comply with human rights agreements, stressing that the Council must not return to its habit of leaving Israeli crimes unpunished.The participants, moreover, denounced the Israeli continued occupation of Palestine, labeling the Israeli expropriation of the Israeli Palestinian lands and the racial segregation wall a gross violation of human rights.They expressed utmost concern over Israel\u2019s excessive policies and a policy of assassination against the Palestinian people, and taking away the Palestinians\u2019 lands by settlers in the occupied

US Senator Richard Black said that the Syrian people achieved a resounding victory on June 3rd when they participated in great numbers in the presidential elections, proving to the world that they challenge with their will and unity the arrogance and terrorism and that they strongly support their president Bashar al-Assad, with whom they look forward to a future full of stability and progress.Speaking to SANA on Sunday, the Virginia Senator stressed the need for a shift in the US-western policy towards Syria, and that Syria must become an ally in the war on terrorism instead of supporting barbaric terrorists who are supported by certain US, western, and Arab sides which are arm, train, fund, and send terrorists to Syria to kill innocent civilians and spread chaos.Black reviewed the two letters he sent to President al-Assad, in the first of which he thanked the Syrian Arab Army for its bravery and valiance in protecting Syrian cities and restoring security and safety, while in the second he expressed admiration of the Syrian people\u2019s unity and their resounding victory embodied in supporting their leadership in combating terrorism and building Syria\u2019s future, voicing hope that Syria will overcome its ordeal and recover its security and peace.The Senator said that his first letter to President al-Assad received considerable coverage by US media because it surprised the American public opinion with its boldness in speaking the truth about Syria, with some media outlets voicing discontent over it. The second letter didn\u2019t receive the same coverage because certain media outlets were worried it might affect its misleading \u201ccredibility\u201d on the events in Syria, particularly during the time of the presidential elections when they failed to cover up or distort the fact that millions of Syrians participated in them, because the strong will of the Syrians and their independence in deciding upon their country\u2019s future was made clear to all.Black said that the US people who fell prey to the fabrications of American and western media regarding what is happening in Syria are beginning to realize that this media lacks objectivity, and that those who call themselves \u201crebels\u201d are terrorists affiliated to Al Qaeda, and therefore the people now believe in the need for a shift in policy towards Syria.He also touched upon the media misdirection which took place regarding using sarin gas in Eastern Ghouta, asserting that the theory claiming that Syrian forces used sarin gas was pointless, illogical, and blatantly and deliberately fake, as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and certain other had motives for such acts which would be used as an excuse to deliver a military strike against Syria, while Syria cooperated greatly with all international and UN efforts to uncover violations of human rights taking place in the country.Black said that there are several western and Arab countries that planned and funded what happened in Syria, noting that former US Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford started off by openly supporting terrorist groups upon his arrival in Syria in January 2011, as was shown in his first visit to Hama in July 2011 during which he affirmed his government\u2019s full support for the terrorists.He said that there was a plan to attack Libya to seize all the weapons that the previous Libyan government had in order to send them to Lebanon and Turkey and from there to Syria, and this plan was carried out, resulting in the destruction of Libya and its infrastructure and the ensuing chaos there.Black hoped that peace will prevail in Syria and among its people who belong to a humane and historical civilization that has always carried a message of love and peace, and that the Syria Arab Army will achieve victory in its war on terrorism.H.
